<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-2207"><div class="book" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title2"><a id="calibre_link-2212" class="firstname"></a>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The editors and authors of this book are from an evolving category of academic institution
        called the “I-School” or “School of Information.”&nbsp; One might suppose that every academic
        department or school could be a “School of Information” since surely law, philosophy,
        political science, chemistry and so on seek to develop and teach the body of information in
        their respective disciplines.&nbsp; But I-Schools are unique in that their focus is not on the
        information IN some discipline, but on information AS a discipline:&nbsp; how is information
        created, organized, used?&nbsp; …&nbsp; </p><p class="calibre5">The assumption driving the emergence of the ISchools is that to understand and thrive in
        the 21st century global information economy requires a synthetic combination of concepts and
        principles from library and information science, computer science, system design, economics,
        business, and other disciplines. The challenge is in getting there from here, because each
        of these fields has its separate academic home, faculty, and conventional textbooks.</p><p class="calibre5">Most existing or potential ischools have their roots in academic programs in library and
        information science.&nbsp; A few have evolved from computer science and taken on a more applied
        informatics character, and other have origins in management of information systems (MIS) or
        information technology (IT) programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some diversity is inevitable and perhaps even
        desirable because it enables each emerging Ischool to best take advantage of its existing
        faculty and to complement the other academic units of its host university.&nbsp; But in practice,
        this means that some Ischool curricula are heavily biased toward traditional library and
        information science courses and texts, while others emphasize computational thinking and
        technology in their courses and texts.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent that each Ischool reflects its
        disciplinary origins rather than the combined interdisciplinary vision, Ischools will not be
        building on a common intellectual foundation.&nbsp; Without one, the lofty goal of a new academic
        field might fade away.</p><p class="calibre5">ISchools might make progress toward a converged vision if they all shared a common
        introductory or gateway course, an “Information 101” that taught the foundational topics
        about how information was created, organized, and used.&nbsp; But such a course is hard to teach
        without a textbook whose scope matches the ISchool vision.&nbsp; In particular, there is a huge
        intellectual gulf between the most popular textbooks that teach the organization of
        information, which are largely oriented toward library science students, and the
        conventional textbooks that teach information retrieval, which are written for computer
        science and implementation-oriented students. In addition, the books in the former category
        primarily discuss information organization topics such as conceptual modeling, metadata
        design, classification, naming, authority control, and standardization from a public sector
        bibliographic perspective. Computer science texts are far more likely to mention the Web,
        multimedia, and other contemporary private sector information design and delivery contexts
        and challenges such as web services,&nbsp; mobile and pervasive computing &ndash; but they ignore or
        de-emphasize the conceptual issues of information organization in favor of algorithms and
        technology-driven opportunities.</p><p class="calibre5">Our hope with this book is to bridge or reunite these complementary disciplines by writing a book
        that can be used in the introductory course in Ischools regardless of their academic roots.&nbsp;
        We do this by emphasizing the intellectual foundations rather than the traditional
        perspectives of each discipline. This way we can discuss topics like information
        integration, information retrieval and natural language processing without needing to dive
        deep into computer science, making these topics more accessible to library and information
        science oriented ISchool students. Similarly, by broadening the topical coverage to include
        more private sector and non-library public sector examples, fundamental concepts of
        information organization can be made relevant to computing-savvy students, whose information
        architectures, systems and application interfaces will become more robust and interoperable
        as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p class="calibre5">Nevertheless, while we’re adding the issues that these new contexts introduce, this is not
        a technlogy-driven application survey of current practice. We can still maintain a rigorous
        conceptual and theoretical focus, because this is a better foundation on which to apply
        concepts to new contexts and systems than a technological one.</p></div></div>

        We propose to unify many perspectives about organizing with 
        the concept of an Organizing System,

        Every Organizing System involves a collection of resources, 
        a choice of properties or principles used to describe and arrange resources, 
        and ways of supporting interactions with resources. 
        By comparing and contrasting how these activities take place 
        in different contexts and domains, we can identify patterns of organizing.

            it without thinking much about it. We organize the shoes in our closet, the books on our
            book shelves, the spices in our kitchen, and the folders into which we file information
            for tax and other purposes. Quite a few of us have jobs that involve specific types of
            organizing tasks. We might even have been explicitly trained to perform them by
            following specialized disciplinary practices. We might learn to do these tasks very
            well, but even then we often do not reflect on the similarity of the organizing tasks we
            do and those done by others, or on the similarity of those we do at work and those we do
            at home. We take for granted and as givens the concepts and methods used in the
            organizing system we work with most often.</p><p class="calibre5">The goal of this book is to help readers become more self-conscious about what it
            means to organize things <span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> whether they are physical resources
            like printed books and shoes or digital resources like web pages and MP3 files
                <span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> and about the principles by which the resources are
            organized. In particular, this book introduces the concept of an <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-466" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-2217" class="calibre1"></a><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing System</em></a></em></strong></span>: <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the
                    interactions they support.</strong></span></span> The book analyzes the design
            decisions that go into any systematic organization of resources and the design patterns
            for the interactions that make use of the resources.</p><p class="calibre5">This book evolved from a master's level university course on <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Information
                Organization &amp; Retrieval</span>”</span> I taught for several years at the <em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-1913" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1">University of California, Berkeley</span>'s <span class="calibre1">School of
                    Information</span></em>. My goal was to synthesize insights from
                <span class="calibre1">library science</span>, <span class="calibre1">information science</span>,
                <span class="calibre1">cognitive science</span>, <span class="calibre1">systems analysis</span>, and
                <span class="calibre1">computer science</span> to provide my students with a richer understanding
            about <span class="calibre1">information organization</span> than any discipline alone could provide.
            I came to realize that information was just one of the many types of resources to
            organize and that it would be beneficial to think about the <span class="calibre1">art and science of
                organizing</span> in a more abstract way. This book is the product of countless
            discussions with students and faculty colleagues at <span class="calibre1">Berkeley</span> and
            other schools, and we are collaboratively developing a new discipline that unifies four
            types of organizing, as follows:</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">We organize physical things</strong></span>. Each of us organizes
            many kinds of <span class="calibre1">things</span> in our lives<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>our books
            on bookshelves; printed financial records in folders and filing cabinets; clothes in
            dressers and closets; cooking and eating utensils in kitchen drawers and cabinets.
            Public libraries organize printed books, periodicals, maps, CDs, DVDs, and maybe some
            old record albums. Research libraries also organize rare manuscripts, pamphlets, musical
            scores, and many other kinds of printed information. Museums organize paintings,
            sculptures, and other artifacts of cultural, historical, or scientific value. Stores and
            suppliers organize their goods for sale to consumers and to each other.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9">We organize information about physical things</strong></span>. Each
            of us organizes information about things, when we inventory the <span class="calibre1">contents of
                our house</span> for insurance purposes, when we sell our <span class="calibre1">unwanted
                stuff</span> on eBay, or when we rate a restaurant on
                <span class="calibre1">Yelp</span>. Library card catalogs, and their online
            replacements, tell us what books a library's collection contains and where to find them.
                <span class="calibre1">Sensors</span> and <span class="calibre1">RFID tags</span> track the movement
            of goods - even library books - through supply chains, and the movement (or lack of
            movement) of <span class="calibre1">cars</span> on highways.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">We organize digital things</strong></span>. Each of us organizes
            personal digital information<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>email, documents, e-books, MP3 and
            video files, appointments, and contacts<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>on our computers, smart
            phone, e-book readers or in <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the cloud,</span>”</span> through information services that
            use Internet protocols. Large research libraries organize digital journals and books,
            computer programs, government and scientific datasets, databases, and many other kinds
            of digital information. Companies organize their digital business records and customer
            information in enterprise applications, content repositories, and databases. Hospitals
            and medical clinics maintain and exchange electronic health records and digital X-rays
            and scans.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">We organize information about digital things</strong></span>.
            Digital library catalogs, web portals and aggregation websites organize links to other
            digital resources. Web search engines use content and link analysis along with relevance
            ratings to organize the billions of web pages competing for our attention. Web-based
            services, data feeds and other information resources can be combined as
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">mash-ups</span>”</span> or choreographed to carry out information-intensive business
            models.</p><p class="calibre5">Let's take a closer look at these four different types or contexts of organizing. Are
            there clear, systematic and useful distinctions between them? We contrasted
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">organizing things</span>”</span> with <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">organizing information.</span>”</span> At
            first glance it might seem that organizing physical things like books, compact discs,
            machine parts, or cooking utensils has an entirely different character than organizing
            intangible digital things. We often arrange physical things according to their shapes,
            sizes, material of manufacture, or other visible properties; for example, we might
            arrange our shirts in the clothes closet by style and color, and we might organize our
            music collection by separating the old vinyl albums from the CDs. We might arrange books
            on bookshelves by their sizes, putting all the big heavy picture books on the bottom
            shelf. Organization for clothes and information artifacts in tangible formats that is
            based on visible properties does not seem much like how you store and organize digital
            books on your Kindle or arrange digital music on your music player. Arranging, storing,
            and accessing X-rays printed on film might appear to have little in common with these
            activities when the X-rays are in digital form.</p><p class="calibre5">It is hardly surprising that organizing things and organizing information sometimes do
            not differ much when information is represented in a tangible way. The era of ubiquitous
            digital information of the last decade or two is just a blip in time compared with the
            more than ten thousand years of human experience with information carved in stone,
            etched in clay, or printed with ink on papyrus, parchment or paper. These tangible
            information artifacts have deeply embedded the notion of information as a physical thing
            in culture, language, and methods of information design and organization. This
            perspective toward tangible information artifacts is especially prominent in rare book
            collections where books are revered as physical objects with a focus on their
            distinctive binding, calligraphy, and typesetting.</p><p class="calibre5">Nevertheless, at other times there are substantial differences in how we organize
            things and how we organize information, even when the latter is in physical form. We
            more often organize our <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">information things</span>”</span> according to what they are
            about rather than on the basis of their visible properties. At home we sort our CDs by
            artist or genre; we keep cookbooks separate from travel books, and fiction books apart
            from reference books. Libraries employ subject-based classification schemes that have a
            few hundred thousand distinct categories.</p><p class="calibre5">Likewise, there are times when we pay little attention to the visible properties of
            tangible things when we organize them and instead arrange them according to functional
            or task properties. We keep screwdrivers, pliers, a hammer, a saw, a drill, and a level
            in a tool box or together on a work bench, even though they have few visual properties
            in common. We are not organizing them because of what we see about them, but because of
            what we know about to use them, The task-based organization of the tools has some
            similarity to the subject-based organization of the library.</p><p class="calibre5">We also contrasted <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">organizing things</span>”</span> with <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">organizing information
                about things.</span>”</span> This difference seems clear if we consider the traditional
            library card catalog, whose printed cards describe and specify the location of books on
            library shelves. When the things and the information about them are both in physical
            format, it is easy to see that the former is a primary resource and the latter a
            surrogate or associated resource that describes or relates to it.</p><p class="calibre5">When it comes to <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">organizing information about digital things</span>”</span> the
            contrast is much less clear, When you search for a book using a search engine, first you
            get the catalog description of the book, and if you're lucky the book itself is just a
            click away. When the things and the information about them are both digital, the
            contrast we posed is not as sharp as when one or both of them is in a physical format.
            And while we used X-rays <span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> on film or in digital format
                <span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> as examples of things we might organize, when a physician
            studies an X-ray, is it not being used as information about the subject of the X-ray,
            namely the patient?</p><p class="calibre5">These differences and relationships between <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">physical

                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">knowledge,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">communication.</span>”</span> Moreover, these
                intellectual and ideological perspectives on information coexist with more mundane
                uses of the term, as when we ask a station agent: <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Can you give me some

                foundation for both modern information science and the information economy and

                much older idea that information is a tangible thing that naturally arose when
                information was inextricably encoded in material formats. We often blur the sense of

                the notion that information is inherently intangible and instead defines it more
                broadly and provocatively based on function. This makes the objects in museum or
                personal collections into information-as-thing resources because they can be learned
                from and serve as evidence.<sup class="calibre10">[<a id="calibre_link-244" href="#calibre_link-176" class="calibre1">1</a>]</sup></p></div><p class="calibre5">The distinctions among organizing physical things, organizing digital things, or
            organizing information about physical things or digital things are challenging to
            describe because many of the words we might use are as overloaded with multiple meanings
            as information itself. For example, some people use the term <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">document</span>”</span> to
            refer only to traditional physical forms, while others use it more abstractly to refer
            to any self-contained unit of information independent of its instantiation in physical
            or digital form. The most abstract definition, presented in <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">What is a

            a zoo, even though it is just an animal when it is running wild on the plains of Africa.
            Similar definitional variation occurs with <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">author</span>”</span> or

                and in what they seek as their solutions. For example, library and information

                perspective, paying careful attention to user requirements for access and

                and we can treat physical things, digital things, and information about such things
                as resources. Every system of organization involves a choice of properties or
                principles used to describe and arrange the resources, and ways of supporting
                interactions with the resources. By comparing and contrasting how these activities
                take place in different contexts and domains, we can identify patterns of organizing

            resources is described and arranged to enable human or computational agents to interact
            with the resources. The Organizing System is an architectural and conceptual view that
            is distinct from the physical arrangement of resources that might embody it, and also
            distinct from the person, enterprise, or institution that implements and operates it.
            These distinctions are sometimes hard to maintain in ordinary language; for example, we
            might describe some set of resource descriptions, organizing principles, and supported
            interactions as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library</span>”</span> Organizing System. However, we also need at
            times to refer to a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library</span>”</span> as the institution in which this Organizing
            System operates, and of course the idea of a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library</span>”</span> as a physical
            facility is deeply engrained in language and culture.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1884" class="calibre1"></a>Our concept of the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing

                Organization</em>. She recognized that the traditional information
            organization activities of bibliographic description and cataloging were complemented,
            and partly compensated for, by automated text processing and indexing that were usually
            treated as part of a separate discipline of information retrieval. She proposed that
            decisions about organizing information and decisions about retrieving information were
            inherently linked by a tradeoff principle and thus needed to be viewed as an
            interconnected system: <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">The effectiveness of a system for accessing

            the more effectively it can be retrieved, and the more effort put into retrieving
            information, the less it needs to be organized first. A systems view no longer contrasts
            information organization as a human activity and information retrieval as a machine
            activity, or information organization as a topic for library and information science and
            information retrieval as one for computer science. Instead, we readily see that

                resources. Similarly, business or scientific data often cannot be understood or
                analyzed without additional information about the manner in which they were
                collected.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-448" class="calibre1"></a>Resources that describe, or are associated with other

                    Systems</em></a>, it is often difficult to distinguish between the resource
                being described and any description of it or associated with it. One challenge is
                that when descriptions are embedded in resources, as metadata often is in the title
                page of a book, in the masthead of a newspaper, or in the source of web pages,
                deciding which resources are primary is often arbitrary. A second challenge is that
                what serves as a metadata for one person or process can function as a primary
                resource or data for another one. Rather than being an inherent distinction, the
                difference between primary and associated resources is often just a decision about
                which resource we are focusing on in some situation. An animal specimen in a natural
                history museum might be a <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-193"><em class="firstterm">primary
                    resource</em></a> for museum visitors and scientists interested in anatomy,
                but information about where the specimen was collected is the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-193"><em class="firstterm">primary resource</em></a> for scientists
                interested in ecology or migration.</p><p class="calibre5">Organizing Systems can refer to people as resources, and we often use that term to
                avoid specifying the gender or specific role of an employee or worker, as in the
                management concept of the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">human resources</span>”</span> or HR department in a firm.
                The shift from a manufacturing to an information and services economy in the last
                few decades has resulted in greater emphasis on intellectual resources represented
                in skills and knowledge rather than on the natural resources of production materials
                and physical goods.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-250" href="#calibre_link-198" class="calibre1">6</a>]</sup> It is important to consider the capabilities and motivations of the
                people who create and participate in Organizing Systems. We might discuss how human
                resources are selected, organized, and managed over time just as we might discuss
                these activities with respect to library resources. Nevertheless, these topics are
                much more appropriate for texts on human resources management and organizational
                behavior so we will not consider them further in this book.</p></div><div class="book" title="1.2.2 The Concept of Collection"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-159" class="firstname"></a>1.2.2 The Concept of <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Collection</span>”</span></h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-339" class="calibre1"></a>A <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-199"><em class="firstterm">collection</em></a></em></strong></span>

                those systems from our definition of Organizing System. These self-organizing
                systems have been used in physics, chemistry, and mathematics to explain phase
                transitions and equilibrium states. Self-organizing is also used to describe
                numerous natural and man-made phenomena like climate, communication networks,
                business and biological ecosystems, traffic and habitation patterns, neural
                networks, and online communities. All of these systems involve collections of
                resources that are very large and open, with complex interactions among the
                resources. The resource arrangements that emerge cannot always be interpreted as the
                result of intentional or deterministic principles and instead are more often
                described in probabilistic or statistical terms. Adam Smith's <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">invisible

                    control of page creation or linking; remote access over the network from
                    anywhere; and the ability to run on a large variety of computers and operating
                    systems. This architecture makes the web open and extensible, but gives it no

                are the result of decisions about what is organized, why it is organized, how much
                it is organized, when it is organized, and how or by whom it is organized (each of
                these will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-164" title="1.3 Design Decisions in Organizing Systems">1.3 Design Decisions in Organizing Systems</a>). An
                Organizing System is defined by the composite impact of the choices made on these

                    realization.</span></p><p class="calibre5">When we organize a <span class="calibre1">bookshelf</span>, <span class="calibre1">home

                        <span class="calibre1">music player</span>, the resources themselves might be new and
                    modern but many of the principles that govern their organization are those that
                    have influenced the design of organizing systems for thousands of years. For
                    example, we organize resources using easily perceived properties to make them
                    easy to locate, we group together resources that we often use together, and we
                    make resources that we use often more accessible than those we use infrequently.
                    Very general and abstract organizing principles are sometimes called design
                    heuristics (for example, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">make things easier to find</span>”</span>). More
                    specific and commonly used organizing principles include alphabetical ordering
                    (arranging resources according to their names) and chronological ordering
                    (arranging resources according to the date of their creation or other important
                    event in the lifetime of the resource). Some organizing principles sort
                    resources into pre-defined categories and other organizing principles rely on
                    novel combinations of resource properties to create new categories.</p><p class="calibre5">Expressing organizing principles in a way that separates design and
                    implementation aligns well with the three-tier architecture familiar to software
                    architects and designers: user interface (implementation of interactions),
                    business logic (intentional arrangement), and data (resources). See the Sidebar,
                            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-207" title="The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems">The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems</a></span>”</span>.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre1"></a><p class="title4">The Three Tiers of Organizing Systems</p><p class="calibre5">Software architects and designers agree that it is desirable to build
                        applications that separate the storage of data, the business logic or
                        functions that use the data, and the user interface or presentation
                        components through which users or other applications interact with the data.
                        This modular architecture allows each of the three tiers to be upgraded or
                        reimplemented independently to satisfy changed requirements or to take
                        advantage of new technologies. An analogous distinction is that between an
                        algorithm as a logical description of a method for solving a computational
                        problem and its implementation in a particular programming language like <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Java</span></span> or <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Python</span></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">These architectural distinctions are equally important to librarians and
                        information scientists. Our new way of looking at Organizing Systems
                        emphasizes the importance of identifying the desired interactions with
                        resources, determining which organizing principles can enable the
                        interactions, and then deciding how to store and manage the resources
                        according to those principles. Applying architectural thinking to Organizing
                        Systems makes it easier to compare and contrast existing ones and design new
                        ones. Separating the organizing principles in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">middle tier</span>”</span>
                        from their implications in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">data</span>”</span> and
                            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">presentation</span>”</span> tiers often makes it possible to implement
                        the same logical Organizing System in different environments that support
                        the same or equivalent interactions with the resources. For example, a new
                        requirement to support searching through a library catalog on a smart phone
                        would only affect the presentation tier.</p></div><p class="calibre5">The logical separation between organizing principles and their implementation
                    is easy to see with digital resources. In a digital library it does not matter
                    to a user if the resources are stored locally or retrieved over a network. The
                    essence of a library Organizing System emerges from the resources that it
                    organizes and the interactions with the resources that it enables. Users
                    typically care a lot about the interactions they can perform, like the kinds of
                    searching and sorting allowed by the online library catalog. How the resources
                    and interactions are implemented are typically of little concern. Similarly,
                    many email applications have migrated to the web and the system of filters and
                    folders that manage email messages is no longer implemented in a local network
                    or on personal computers, but most people neither notice nor care.</p><p class="calibre5">The separation of organizing principles and their implementation is harder to
                    recognize in an Organizing System that only contains <span class="calibre1">physical
                        resources</span>, such as your <span class="calibre1">kitchen</span> or
                        <span class="calibre1">clothes closet</span>, where you appear to have unmediated
                    interactions with resources rather than accessing them through some kind of user
                    interface or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">presentation tier</span>”</span> that supports the principles
                    specified in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">middle tier</span>”</span> and realized in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">storage
                        tier.</span>”</span> Nevertheless, you can see these different tiers in the
                    organization of <span class="calibre1">spices in a kitchen</span>. Different kitchens
                    might all embody an <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">alphabetic order</span>”</span> organizing principle for
                    arranging a collection of spices, but the exact locations and arrangement of the
                    spices in any particular kitchen depends on the configuration of shelves and
                    drawers, whether a spice rack or rotating tray is used, and other storage-tier
                    considerations. Similarly, spices could be logically organized by cuisine, with
                    Indian spices separated from Mexican spices, but this organizing principle does
                    not imply anything about where they can be found in the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-357" class="calibre1"></a>Because <span class="calibre1">tangible things</span> can

                    in any Organizing System directly reflect the mix of these two embodiments of
                    information; in this way we can think of the modern library as a digital
                    Organizing System that primarily relies on digital resources to organize a
                    mixture of physical and digital ones.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre1"></a>The Organizing System for a

                    spices in your kitchen, you do not need to alphabetize them because it is easy
                    to find the one you want.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-254" href="#calibre_link-210" class="calibre1">10</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-389" class="calibre1"></a>Some organization emerges implicitly through

                        clothes closet, the resources you use most often migrate to the front. But
                        as a collection grows in size, the time to arrange, locate, and retrieve a
                        particular resource becomes more important and the collection must be
                        explicitly organized to make these interactions efficient.</span> As a
                    result, most Organizing Systems employ organizing principles that make use of
                    properties of the resources being organized (for example, name, color, shape,
                    date of creation, semantic or biological category), and multiple properties are
                    often used simultaneously. For example, in your kitchen you might arrange your
                        <span class="calibre1">cooking pots</span> and pans by <span class="calibre1">size and
                        shape</span> so you can nest them and store them compactly, but you
                    might also arrange things by cuisine or style and separate your grilling
                    equipment from the wok and other items you use for making Chinese food.</p><p class="calibre5">Unlike those for physical resources, the most useful organizing properties for
                    information resources are those based on their content and meaning, and these
                    are not directly apparent when you look at a book or document. Significant
                    intellectual effort or computation is necessary to reveal these properties when
                    assigning subject terms or creating an index. The most effective organizing
                    systems for information resources often are based on properties that emerge from
                    analyzing the collection as a whole. For example, the relevance of documents to
                    a search query is higher when they contain a higher than average frequency of
                    the query terms compared to other documents in the collection, or when they are
                    linked to relevant documents. Likewise, algorithms for classifying email
                    messages continuously recalculate the probability that words like
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">beneficiary</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Viagra</span>”</span> indicate whether a

                    resources, but many Organizing Systems provide additional

                    resources. For example, libraries and similar Organizing Systems implement
                    catalogs to enable interactions for <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><span class="calibre1">finding</span></strong></span> a known resource, <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><span class="calibre1">identifying</span></strong></span> any resource in the

                determined by the characteristics of the resource. Because many museum resources are
                unique or extremely valuable, visitors are allowed to <span class="calibre1">view</span> them but
                cannot <span class="calibre1">borrow</span> them, in contrast with most of the resources in
                libraries. A library might have multiple printed copies of <em class="firstterm">Moby
                    Dick</em> but can never lend more of them than it possesses. After a
                printed book is checked out from the library, there are many types of interactions

                Organizing System and are invisible to it. For works not in the public domain,
                copyright law gives the copyright holder the right to <span class="calibre1">prevent some
                    uses</span>, but at the same time <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">fair use</span>”</span> and similar
                copyright doctrines enable certain limited uses even for copyrighted works.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-257" href="#calibre_link-215" class="calibre1">13</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Digital resources enable a greater range of interactions than physical ones. Any
                number of people or processes can request a weather forecast from a web-based
                weather service because the forecast is not used up by the request and the marginal
                cost of allowing another access is nearly zero. Furthermore, with digital resources
                many new kinds of interactions can be enabled through application software, web
                services, or <em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-1424" class="calibre1"></a>application program interfaces (<abbr class="calibre1">API</abbr>s)</em> in the Organizing System. In particular,
                translation, summarization, annotation, and keyword suggestion are highly useful
                services that are commonly supported by web search engines and other web
                applications. Similarly, an Organizing System with digital resources can implement a
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">keep everything up to date</span>”</span> interaction that automatically pushes
                current content to your browser or computing device.</p><p class="calibre5">But just as technology can enable interactions, it can prevent or constrain them.
                If your collection of digital resources (ebooks or music, for example) is not stored
                on your own computer or device, a continuous Internet connection is a requirement
                for access. In addition, access control policies and <span class="calibre1">digital rights
                    management (<abbr class="calibre1">DRM</abbr>)</span> technology can limit the devices
                that can access the collection and prevent copying, annotation and other actions
                that might otherwise be enabled by the fair use doctrine.</p><p class="calibre5">Just as with organizing principles, it is useful to think of interactions in an
                abstract or logical way that does not assume an implementation because it can
                encourage innovative designs for Organizing Systems. See the Sidebar, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-216" title="The Digital Zoo">The Digital Zoo</a></span>”</span>.</p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-216" class="calibre1"></a><p class="title4">The Digital Zoo</p><p class="calibre5">Consider the Organizing System of a zoo, which typically organizes the

                    or common habitat. The most important interaction supported by a modern zoo is
                    enabling visitors to <span class="calibre1">observe</span> the behavior of animals in
                    environments resembling their natural environments.</p><p class="calibre5">If all the animals are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">stored</span>”</span> in a single location and we

                    and showcasing the animals and our own mobility limits how big a zoo can be.
                    However, this is simply a conventional manner of storing the animals and
                    supporting interactions with them.</p><p class="calibre5">We can imagine a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">digital zoo</span>”</span> in which all of the world's zoos
                    are treated as a single digital collection. Instead of physical co-presence to

                    connections to zoo exhibits would enable us to view animals in the San Diego,

                    if we were there. Instead of a walk from exhibit to exhibit, a tour of a digital
                    zoo would be implemented as a list of video connections, and different tours
                    implemented as different sequences of cameras. Sensors in each animal habitat
                    could detect activity and image recognition software could classify the
                    behavior, enabling us to search the combined zoo for particular combinations of
                    active animals to view (e.g., a mother and infant chimpanzee). No zoo would need
                    to change how it <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">stores</span>”</span> the animals to enable these new

            descriptions and other properties; the classes, relations, structures and collections in
            which they participate; and the people or technologies who interact with them.</p><p class="calibre5">One important contribution of the idea of the Organizing System is that it moves
            beyond the debate about the definitions of things, documents, and information with the
            unifying concept of resource while acknowledging that <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what is being

            designers and users of the Organizing System (who may be the same people or different
            ones); on the economic or emotional or societal purpose of the Organizing System; and on

                obvious and traditional approach. We can also classify Organizing Systems by their

                    because they contain different kinds of resources. Similarly, we distinguish
                        <span class="calibre1">document collections</span> by resource type, contrasting
                    narrative document types like novels and biographies with transactional ones
                    like catalogs and invoices, with hybrid forms like textbooks and encyclopedias
                    in between.</p><p class="calibre5">But there are three other conventional ways to classify Organizing Systems. A
                    second way to distinguish Organizing Systems is by their dominant purposes or
                    the priority of their common purposes. For example, libraries, museums, and
                    archives are often classified as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">memory institutions</span>”</span> to emphasize
                    their primary emphasis on resource preservation. In contrast, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">management
                        information systems</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">business systems</span>”</span> are
                    categories that include the great variety of software applications that
                    implement the Organizing Systems needed to carry out day-to-day business
                    operations.</p><p class="calibre5">A third conventional approach for classifying Organizing Systems is according
                    to the nature or size of the intended user community. This size or scope can
                    range from personal Organizing Systems created and used by a single person; to
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">community-based</span>”</span> Organizing Systems used by informal social
                    groups; to those used by the employees, customers or stakeholders of an
                    enterprise; to those used by an entire community or nation; to global ones
                    potentially used by anyone in the world.</p><p class="calibre5">A fourth way to distinguish Organizing Systems is according to the technology
                    used to implement them. Large businesses use different software applications for
                    inventory management, records management, content management, knowledge
                    management, customer relationship management, data warehousing and business
                    intelligence, e-mail archiving, and other subcategories of collections.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-258" href="#calibre_link-217" class="calibre1">14</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">We can become overwhelmed by this proliferation of ways to classify
                    collections of resources, especially when the classification is not clearly
                    based on just one of these many approaches. For example, the list of

                    resource-based distinctions (e.g. art libraries, law libraries, social science
                    libraries), purpose-based ones (e.g., academic and research libraries), and
                    user-based distinctions (e.g., public libraries, school libraries, libraries

                    point of a discipline. Category labels like library, museum, zoo, and data
                    repository have core meanings and many associated experiences and practices.
                    Specialized concepts and vocabularies often evolve to describe these. The
                    richness that follows from this complex social and cultural construction makes
                    it difficult to define category boundaries precisely.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider Borgman's commonly accepted definition of libraries as institutions

                        Similarly, even though the resources in its collection are encyclopedia
                        articles rather than living species, the Wikipedia open-source encyclopedia

                        transform it into a searchable shared collection, and many people also think
                        of Flickr as a photo library. But Flickr lacks the authoritative description
                        and standard classification that typify a library.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1462" class="calibre1"></a>A similar categorization challenge arises with the

                            forever.</span>”</span> But the <span class="calibre1">Google Books</span> project
                        was widely criticized as not being true to library principles.<sup class="calibre10">[<a id="calibre_link-260" href="#calibre_link-221" class="calibre1">16</a>]</sup></p></div><p class="calibre5">We can always create new categories by stretching the conventional definitions
                    of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library</span>”</span> or other familiar Organizing Systems and adding
                    modifiers, as when <span class="calibre1">Flickr</span> is described as a web-based
                    photo-sharing library. But whenever we define an Organizing System with respect
                    to a familiar category, the typical or mainstream instances and characteristics
                    of that category that are deeply embedded in language and culture are
                    reinforced, and those that are atypical are marginalized. In the
                        <span class="calibre1">Flickr</span> case this means we suggest features that
                    are not there (like authoritative classification) or omit the features that are
                    distinctive (like tagging by users).</p><p class="calibre5">More generally, a categorical view of Organizing Systems makes it matter
                    greatly which category is used to anchor definitions or comparisons. The
                        <span class="calibre1">Google Books</span> project makes out-of-print and
                    scholarly works vastly more accessible, but framing it in library terms to
                    suggest it is a public good upsets many people with a more traditional sense of
                    what the library category implies. We can readily identify design choices in
                        <span class="calibre1">Google Books</span> that are more characteristic of the
                    Organizing Systems in business domains, and the project might have been
                    perceived more favorably had it been described as an online bookstore that
                    offered many beneficial services for free.</p><p class="calibre5">A complementary perspective on Organizing Systems is that they exist in a
                    multi-faceted or multi-dimensional design space. This <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-181"><em class="firstterm">framework</em></a> for describing and comparing
                    Organizing Systems overcomes some of the biases and conservatism built into
                    familiar categories like libraries, museums, and archives, while enabling us to
                    describe them as design patterns that embody characteristic configurations of
                    design choices. We can then use these patterns to support multi-disciplinary
                    work that cuts across categories and applies knowledge about familiar domains to
                    unfamiliar ones. A dimensional perspective makes it easier to translate between
                    category and discipline-specific vocabularies so that people from different
                    disciplines can have mutually intelligible discussions about their organizing
                    activities. They might realize that they have much in common, and they might be
                    working on similar or even the same problems.</p><p class="calibre5">A faceted or dimensional perspective acknowledges the diversity of instances
                    of collection types and provides a generative, forward-looking framework for
                    describing hybrid types that do not cleanly fit into the familiar categories.
                    Even though it might differ from the conventional categories on some dimensions,
                    an Organizing System can be designed and understood by its <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">family
                        resemblance</span>”</span> on the basis of its similarities on other dimensions to
                    a familiar type of resource collection.</p><p class="calibre5">Thinking of <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing
                        Systems</em></a> as points or regions in a design space makes it easier
                    to invent new or more specialized types of collections and their associated
                    interactions. If we think metaphorically of this design space as a map of
                    Organizing Systems, the empty regions or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white space</span>”</span> between the
                    densely-populated centers of the traditional categories represent Organizing
                    Systems that do not yet exist. We can consider the properties of an Organizing
                    System that could occupy that white space and analyze the technology, process,
                    or policy innovations that might be required to let us build it there. Try this
                    analogy test: <span class="calibre1">Google Books</span> is to Library as ? is to

                In different situations, the same thing can be treated as a unique item, as one of
                many equivalent members of a broad category, or as component of an item rather than
                as an item on its own. For example, in a museum collection, a <span class="calibre1">handmade

                surrogates like bibliographic records or descriptions that distinguish one resource
                from another; and to create additional organizational mechanisms like
                    <span class="calibre1">shelf labels</span>, <span class="calibre1">store directories</span>,
                    <span class="calibre1">library card catalogs</span> and <span class="calibre1">indexes</span> that
                facilitate understanding the collection and locating the resources it contains.
                These organizational mechanisms often suggest or parallel the organizing principles
                used to organize the collection itself.</p><p class="calibre5">Organization mechanisms like <span class="calibre1">aisle signs</span>, store directories
                and library card catalogs are embedded in the same physical environment as the
                resources being organized. But when these mechanisms or surrogates are digitized,
                the new capabilities that they enable create design challenges. This is because a
                digital Organizing System can be designed and operated according to more abstract
                and less constraining principles than an Organizing System that only contains
                physical resources. A single physical resource can only be in one
                    <span class="calibre1">place</span> at a time, and interactions with it are constrained
                by its <span class="calibre1">size</span>, <span class="calibre1">location</span>, and other
                properties. In contrast, digital copies and surrogates can exist in many places at
                once and enable searching, sorting, and other interactions with an efficiency and
                scale impossible for tangible things.</p><p class="calibre5">When the resources being organized consist of information content, deciding on the
                unit of organization is challenging because it might be necessary to look beyond
                physical properties and consider conceptual or intellectual equivalence. A high
                school student told to study Shakespeare's play <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em> might
                treat any printed copy or web version as equivalent, and might even try to outwit
                the teacher by watching a film adaptation of the play. To the student, all versions
                of <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em> seem to be the same resource, but librarians and
                scholars make much finer distinctions.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-263" href="#calibre_link-224" class="calibre1">19</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Archival <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing

                    have themselves been previously organized as a result of the processes that

                different from the structural digital format in which more recent information is
                likely to be preserved. When legacy conversions from printed information artifacts
                are complete or unnecessary, an Organizing System no longer deals with any of the

                these artifacts, replacing them with the capability to print copies if needed. This
                enables libraries of digital documents or data collections to be vastly larger and

                both. In practice the digital representations of texts are often just image scans

                the digital representations of music, photographs, videos, and other non-text

                describe or arrange resources so they can be located and accessed later. The
                organizing principles needed to achieve this goal depend on the types of resources
                or domains being organized, and in the personal, social, or institutional setting in
                which organization takes place. <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Bringing like things together</span>”</span> is an
                informal organizing principle for many Organizing Systems. But there will likely be
                a number of more precise requirements or constraints to satisfy.</p><p class="calibre5">Organizing Systems involving <span class="calibre1">physical resources</span> are more
                likely to emphasize aesthetic or emotional goals than those for information
                resources, which more often are dominated by functional goals like
                    <span class="calibre1">efficiency of storage</span> and <span class="calibre1">access</span>. This
                contrast is often magnified by the tendency for major library and museum collections
                to be housed in buildings designed as architectural monuments that over time become
                symbols of national or cultural identity.</p><p class="calibre5">The fine distinctions between Organizing Systems that have many characteristics in
                common reflect subtle differences in the priority of their shared goals. For
                example, many Organizing Systems create collections and enable interactions with the
                goals of supporting scientific research, public education, and entertainment. We can
                contrast zoos, animal theme parks, and wild animal preserves in terms of the
                absolute and relative importance of these three goals.</p><p class="calibre5">When individuals manage their <span class="calibre1">papers</span>,
                    <span class="calibre1">books</span>, <span class="calibre1">documents</span>, <span class="calibre1">record

                <span class="calibre1">DVDs</span>, and other information resources, their Organizing Systems
                vary greatly. This is in part because the content of the resources being organized
                becomes a consideration. Furthermore, many of the Organizing Systems used by
                individuals are implemented by web applications, and this makes them more accessible
                because their resources can be accessed from anywhere with a web browser.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-265" href="#calibre_link-227" class="calibre1">21</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Put another way, an information resource inherently has more potential uses than
                resources like <span class="calibre1">forks</span> or <span class="calibre1">frying pans</span>, so it
                is not surprising that the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing

                    <span class="calibre1">kitchens</span>.</p><p class="calibre5">When the scale of the collection or the number of intended users increases, not
                everyone is likely to share the same goals and design preferences for the Organizing
                System. If you share a kitchen with housemates, you might have to negotiate and
                compromise on some of the decisions about how the kitchen is organized so you can
                all get along. In more formal or institutional Organizing Systems conflicts between
                stakeholders can be much more severe, and the organizing principles might even be
                specified in commercial contracts or governed by law. For example, Bowker and Star
                note that physicians view the creation of patient records as central to diagnosis
                and treatment, insurance companies think of them as evidence needed for payment and
                reimbursement, and researchers think of them as primary data. Not surprisingly,
                policymaking and regulations about patient records are highly contentious.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-266" href="#calibre_link-228" class="calibre1">22</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">We can look back to the invention of mechanized printing in the fifteenth century,

                systematic methods for cataloging and classifying what they owned and to view
                themselves as doing more than just preserving a collection. Libraries began
                progressively more refined efforts to state the functional requirements for their
                Organizing Systems and to be explicit about how they met those requirements.</p><p class="calibre5">Today, the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing

                resources in their collections. In these respects, the Organizing Systems in

                    to their collections, large libraries also need business Organizing Systems to
                    support acquisition, billing, interlibrary loan record routing and systems,
                    licenses of digital resources from publishers, course material websites, and the
                    library's own web presence. Commercial firms need processes for transacting with
                    customers or other firms to carry out business operations, to support research
                    and innovation, and to develop business strategy and tactics in compliance with
                    laws and regulations for accounting, taxes, human resources, data retention, and
                    so on. In large firms these functions are so highly specialized and complex that

                applied to each resource and the amount of organization of resources into classes or

                questions about the nature and extent of description in Organizing Systems.</p><p class="calibre5">Not all resources in a collection require the same degree of description for the
                simple reason we discussed in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-169" title="1.3.3 Why is it Being Organized?">1.3.3 Why is it Being Organized?</a>: Organizing Systems
                exist for different purposes and to support different kinds of interactions or
                functions. Let's contrast two ends of the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">degree of description</span>”</span>
                continuum. Many people use <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">current events awareness</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">news
                    feed</span>”</span> applications that select news stories whose titles or abstracts
                contain one or more keywords. This exact match algorithm is easy to implement, but
                its all-or-none and one-item-at-a-time comparison misses any stories that use
                synonyms of the keyword, that are written in languages different from that of the
                keyword, or that are otherwise relevant but do not contain the exact keyword in the
                limited part of the document that is scanned. However, users with current events
                awareness goals do not need to see every news story about some event, and this
                limited amount of description for each story and the simple method of comparing
                descriptions are sufficient.</p><p class="calibre5">On the other hand, this simple Organizing System is inadequate for the purpose of
                comprehensive retrieval of all documents that relate to some concept, event, or
                problem. This is a critical task for scholars, scientists, inventors, physicians,
                attorneys and similar professionals who might need to discover every relevant
                document in some domain. Instead, this type of Organizing System needs rich
                bibliographic and semantic description of each document, most likely assigned by
                professional cataloguers, and probably using terms from a <em class="firstterm"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-99"><em class="firstterm">controlled
                    vocabulary</em></a></em> to enforce consistency in what descriptions
                mean.</p><p class="calibre5">Similarly, different merchants or firms might make different decisions about the
                extent or granularity of description when they assign <abbr class="calibre1">SKU</abbr>s because
                of differences in suppliers, targeted customers, or other business strategies. If
                you take your car to the repair shop because windshield wiper fluid is leaking, you
                might be dismayed to find that the broken <span class="calibre1">rubber seal</span> that is
                causing the leak cannot be ordered separately and you have to pay to replace the
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">wiper fluid reservoir</span></span>”</span> for which the seal
                is a minor but vital part. Likewise, when two business applications try to exchange
                and merge customer information, integration problems will arise if one describes a
                customer as a single <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">NAME</span>”</span> component while the other separates the
                customer's name into <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">TITLE</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">FIRSTNAME,</span>”</span> and

                organization they prefer or how much disorganization they can tolerate. A classic

                the strategies and methods of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">filers</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pilers.</span>”</span>
                Filers maintain clean desktops and systematically organize their papers into
                categories, while pilers have messy work areas and make few attempts at
                organization. This contrast has analogues in other organizing systems and we can
                easily imagine what happens if a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">neat freak</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">slob</span>”</span>
                become roommates.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-267" href="#calibre_link-229" class="calibre1">23</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Different preferences and disagreements between stakeholders in an Organizing
                System about how much organization is necessary often result because of the
                implications for who does the work and who gets the benefits. Physicians prefer
                narrative descriptions and broad classification systems because they make it easier
                to create patient notes. In contrast, insurance companies and researchers want
                fine-grained <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">form-filling</span>”</span> descriptions and detailed classifications
                that would make the physician's work more onerous.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-268" href="#calibre_link-230" class="calibre1">24</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">The cost-effectiveness of creating systematic and comprehensive descriptions of
                the resources in an information collection has been debated for nearly two centuries
                and in the last half century the scope of the debate grew to consider the role of
                computer-generated resource descriptions.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-269" href="#calibre_link-231" class="calibre1">25</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">An alternative and complement to man-made descriptions for each resource are
                computer-generated indexes of their textual contents. These indexes typically assign
                weights to the terms according to calculations that consider the frequency and
                distribution of the terms in both individual documents and in the collection as a
                whole to create a description of what the documents are about. These descriptions of
                the documents in the collection are more consistent than those created by human
                organizers. They allow for more complex query processing and comparison operations
                by the retrieval functions in the Organizing System. For example, query expansion
                mechanisms or thesauri can automatically add synonyms and related terms to the
                search. Additionally, retrieved documents can be arranged by relevance, while
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">citing</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">cited-by</span>”</span> links can be analyzed to find
                related relevant documents.</p><p class="calibre5">A second constraint on the degree of organization comes from the absolute size of
                the collection within the scope of the Organizing System. Organizing more resources
                requires more descriptions to distinguish any particular resource from the rest and
                more constraining organizing principles. Similar resources need to be grouped or
                classified to emphasize the most important distinctions among the complete set of
                resources in the collection. A small neighborhood restaurant might have a short wine
                list with just ten wines, arranged in two categories for <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">red</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white</span>”</span> and described only by the wine's name and price. In
                contrast, a gourmet restaurant might have hundreds of wines in its wine list, which
                would subdivide its <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">red</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white</span>”</span> high-level
                categories into subcategories for country, region of origin, and grape varietal. The
                description for each wine might in addition include a specific vineyard from which
                the grapes were sourced, the vintage year, ratings of the wine, and tasting
                notes.</p><p class="calibre5">At some point a collection grows so large that it is not economically feasible for
                people to create bibliographic descriptions or to classify each separate resource,
                unless there are so many users of the collection that their aggregated effort is
                comparably large; this is organizing by <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">crowdsourcing</span>”</span> (See the
                Sidebar on <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Web 2.0</span>”</span> in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-172" title="1.3.6 How (or by Whom) is it Organized?">1.3.6 How (or by Whom) is it Organized?</a>). This leaves
                two approaches that can be done separately or in tandem. The simpler approach is to
                describe sets of resources or documents as a set or group, which is especially
                sensible for archives with its emphasis on the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-225"><em class="firstterm">fonds</em></a> (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-168" title="1.3.2 What is Being Organized?">1.3.2 What is Being Organized?</a>). The
                second approach is to rely on automated and more general-purpose organizing
                technologies that organize resources through computational means. Search engines are
                familiar examples of computational organizing technology, and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-232" title="7.6 Computational Classification – Supervised Learning">7.6 Computational Classification &ndash; Supervised Learning</a>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Computational Classification,</span>”</span> describes
                other common techniques in machine learning, clustering, and discriminant analysis

            have been essential human activities for millennia, evolving both in response to human
            needs and to enable new ones. <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">Organizing
                Systems</em></a> enabled the development of civilization, from agriculture and
            commerce to government and warfare. Today Organizing Systems are embedded in every
            domain of purposeful activity, including research, education, law, medicine, business,
            science, institutional memory, sociocultural memory, governance, public accountability,
            as well as in the ordinary acts of daily living.</p><p class="calibre5">Many of the foundational topics for a discipline of organizing have traditionally been
            presented from the perspective of the public sector library and taught as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library
                and information science.</span>”</span> These include bibliographic description,
            classification, naming, authority control, and information standards. We need to update
            and extend the coverage of these topics to include more private sector and
            non-bibliographic contexts, multi- and social media, and new information-intensive
            applications and service systems enabled by mobile, pervasive, and scientific computing.
            In so doing we can reframe the foundational concepts to make them equally compatible
            with the disciplinary perspectives of informatics, data and process modeling, and
            document engineering.</p><p class="calibre5">With the Web and ubiquitous digital information, along with effectively unlimited
            processing, storage and communication capability, millions of people create and browse
            web sites, blog, tag, tweet, and upload and download content of all media types without
            thinking <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">I'm organizing now</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">I'm retrieving now.</span>”</span> Writing
            a book used to mean a long period of isolated work by an author followed by the
            publishing of a completed artifact, but today some books are continuously and
            iteratively written and published through the online interactions of authors and
            readers. When people use their <span class="calibre1">smart phones</span> to search the web or
            run applications, location information transmitted from their phone is used to filter
            and reorganize the information they retrieve. Arranging results to make them fit the
            user's location is a kind of computational curation, but because it takes place quickly
            and automatically we hardly notice it.</p><p class="calibre5">Likewise, almost every application that once seemed predominantly about information
            retrieval is now increasingly combined with activities and functions that most would
            consider to be information organization. <span class="calibre1">Google</span>,
                <span class="calibre1">Microsoft</span>, and other search engine operators have deployed
            millions of computers to analyze billions of web pages and millions of books and
            documents to enable the almost instantaneous retrieval of published or archival
            information. However, these firms increasingly augment this retrieval capability with
            information services that organize information in close to real-time. Further, the
            selection and presentation of search results, advertisements, and other information can
            be tailored for the person searching for information using his implicit or explicit
            preferences, location, or other <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-242"><em class="firstterm">contextual information</em></a>.</p><p class="calibre5">Taken together, these innovations in technology and its application mean that the

                retrieval</span>”</span> that is often manifested in academic disciplines and curricula is
            much less important than it once was. This book has few sharp divisions between
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">information organization</span>”</span> (<abbr class="calibre1">IO</abbr>) and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">information

            concepts and challenges in the design and deployment of Organizing Systems in a way that
            continuously emphasizes the relationships and tradeoffs between <abbr class="calibre1">IO</abbr> and
                <abbr class="calibre1">IR</abbr>. The concept of the Organizing System highlights the design
            dimensions and decisions that collectively determine the extent and nature of resource
            organization and the capabilities of the processes that compare, combine, transform and

                                foreign governments, and numerous individuals (Samuelson, 2011). </p><p class="calibre5">The major reason for the rejection was that the settlement was a
                                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">bridge too far</span>”</span> that went beyond the claims made
                                against Google to address issues that were not in litigation. In
                                particular, the judge objected to the treatment of the so-called
                                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">orphan books</span>”</span> that were still under copyright but
                                out of print because money they generated went to the parties in the
                                settlement and not to the rights holders who could not be located
                                (why the books are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">orphans</span>”</span>) or to defray the costs of
                                subscriptions to the digital book collection. The judge also was
                                concerned that the settlement did not adequately address the
                                concerns of academic authors <span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> who wrote most
                                of the books scanned from research libraries

                                freely available rather than seek to maximize profits from them.
                                Other concerns were that the settlement would have entrenched
                                Google's monopoly in the search market and that there were
                                inadequate controls for protecting the privacy of readers.</p><p class="calibre5">Google's plan would have dramatically increased access to out of
                                print books, and the rejection of the proposed settlement has
                                heightened calls for an open public digital library (Darnton, 2011),
                                which could perhaps be started using the digital copies that the
                                research libraries received in return for giving Google books to

                        rules for the British Library that defined authoritative forms for titles
                        and author names, but the complexity of the rules and the resulting resource
                        descriptions were widely criticized. For example, the famous author and
                        historian Thomas Carlyle argued that a library catalog should be nothing
                        more than a list of the names of the books in it. Standards for
                        bibliographic description are essential if resources are to be shared
                        between libraries. See Denton, 2007, Anderson and Perez-Carballo 2001a,

                        descriptions are not always correct. For example, Microsoft Office

                    color, by fabric, or style. We can view dress shirts, T-shirts,
                        <span class="calibre1">Hawaiian shirts</span> and other styles as configurations of
                    shirt properties that are so frequent and familiar that they have become
                    linguistic and cultural categories. Other people might think about these same
                    properties or categories differently, using a greater or lesser number of colors
                    or ordering them differently, sorting the shirts by style first and then by
                    color, or vice versa.</p><p class="calibre5">In addition to, or instead of, physical properties of your shirts, you might
                    employ behavioral or usage-based properties to arrange them. You might separate
                    your party and Hawaiian shirts from those you wear to the office. You might put
                    the shirts you wear most often in the front of the closet so they are easy to
                    locate. Unlike intrinsic properties of resources, which do not change,
                    behavioral or usage-based properties are dynamic. You might move to Hawaii,
                    where you can wear Hawaiian shirts to the office, or you could get tired of what
                    were once your favorite shirts and stop wearing them as often as you used
                    to.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">Some arrangements of physical resources are constrained or precluded
                        by resource properties that might cause problems for other resources or for

                    not be kept in a library where children might accidentally find them. For almost
                    any resource, it seems possible to imagine a combination with another resource

                information services have some important differences from those that organize
                physical resources. Because digital resources can be easily copied or interlinked,
                they are free from the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">one place at a time</span></span>”</span>
                    limitation.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1148" href="#calibre_link-672" class="calibre1">44</a>]</sup> The actual <span class="calibre1">storage locations</span> for digital resources
                are no longer visible or very important. It hardly matters if a digital document or

                accessed efficiently.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1149" href="#calibre_link-1056" class="calibre1">45</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Moreover, because the functions and capabilities of digital resources are not
                directly manifested as physical properties, the constraints imposed on all
                    <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-1057"><em class="firstterm">material</em></a> objects do not
                matter to digital content in many circumstances.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1150" href="#calibre_link-1058" class="calibre1">46</a>]</sup><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1151" href="#calibre_link-1059" class="calibre1">47</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">An organizing system for digital resources can also use digital description
                resources that are associated with them. Since the incremental costs of adding
                processing and <span class="calibre1">storage capacity</span> to digital organizing systems
                are small, collections of both primary digital resources and description resources
                can be arbitrarily large. Digital organizing systems can support collections and
                interactions at a scale that is impossible in organizing systems that are entirely
                physical, and they can implement services and functions that exploit the
                exponentially growing processing, storage and communication capabilities available
                    today.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1152" href="#calibre_link-1060" class="calibre1">48</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">There are inherently more choices in the arrangement of digital resources
                    than there are for physical ones, but this difference emerges because of
                    multiple implementation platforms for the organizing system as much as in the
                    nature of the resources.</span> Nevertheless, the organizing systems for
                digital books, music and video collections often maintain the distinctions embodied
                in the organizing system for physical resources because it enables their
                co-existence or simply because of legacy inertia. As a result, the organizing
                systems for collections of digital resources tend to be coarsely distinguished by
                media type (e.g., document management, digital music collection, digital video
                collection, digital photo collection, etc.).</p><p class="calibre5">Information resources in either physical or digital form are typically organized
                using intrinsic properties like author names, creation dates, publisher, or the set
                of words that they contain. Information resources can also be organized using
                extrinsic or behavioral properties like subject classifications, assigned names or
                identifiers, or even access frequency.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1153" href="#calibre_link-1061" class="calibre1">49</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Complex organization and interactions are possible when organizing systems with
                digital resources are based on the data type or data model of the digital content
                (e.g., text, numeric, multimedia, statistical, geospatial, logical, scientific, or
                personnel data). These distinctions are often strongly identifiable with business
                functions: operational, transactional and process control activities require the
                most fine-grained data, while strategic functions might rely on more qualitative
                analyses represented in narrative text formats. Managerial and decision support
                functions might require a mixture of digital content types.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">With digital resources we don't have to worry about hazardous resources

                    the zoo antelopes if lions are kept too close.</span> Accordingly, just as
                there are many laws and regulations that restrict the organization of physical
                resources, there are laws and regulations that constrain the arrangements of digital
                ones. <span class="calibre1">Many information systems that generate or collect transactional data

                <span class="calibre1">The top level categories of resources are created based on the values of the
                    property evaluated first, and then each category is further subdivided using
                    other properties until each resource is classified in only a single
                    category.</span> A typical example of hierarchical arrangement for digital
                resources is the system of directories or folders used by a professor to arrange his
                personal document collection in a computer file system; the first level
                distinguishes personal documents from work-related documents; work is then
                subdivided into teaching and research, teaching is subdivided by year, and year
                divided by course. For <span class="calibre1">physical resources</span>, an additional step
                of mapping categories to <span class="calibre1">physical locations</span> is required; for
                example, resources in the category <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">kitchen
                    utensils</span></span>”</span> might all be arranged in drawers near a workspace,
                with <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">silverware</span>”</span> arranged more precisely to separate knives, forks,
                and spoons.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">An alternative to hierarchical organization that is often used in digital
                    organizing systems is <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-320"><em class="firstterm">faceted
                        classification</em></a></strong></span>, in which the different properties for
                    the resources can be evaluated in any order.</span> For example, you can
                select wines from the <span class="calibre1">wine.com</span> store catalog by type of
                grape, cost, or region and consider these property facets in any order. Three people
                might each end up choosing the same moderately-priced <span class="calibre1">Kendall Jackson
                    California Chardonnay</span>, but one of them might have started the
                search based on price, one based on the grape varietal, and the third with the
                region. This kind of interaction in effect generates a different logical hierarchy
                for every different combination of property values, and each user made his final
                    <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-286"><em class="firstterm">selection</em></a> from a different set

                    that it allows a collection of description resources to be dynamically
                    re-organized into as many categories as there are combinations of values on the
                    descriptive facets, depending on the priority or point of view the user applies
                    to the facets.</span> Of course this only works because the <span class="calibre1">physical

                and understand the possible interactions. With computers, information systems, and
                digital resources in general, considerations about affordances and capabilities are
                not as straightforward. First, the affordances we can perceive might not be tied to
                any useful interaction. <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Donald</span> <span class="calibre1">Norman</span></span> joked that every computer screen within reaching distance affords

                measure does not take into account differences in the capability or generality of a
                particular interaction. For example, two organizing systems might both have a search
                function, but differences in the operators they allow, the sophistication of

                personalize recommendations. This has the effect of substituting information for

                activities can be treated as design parameters, especially where the value created
                by retrieving or computing information could be completely separated or

                    contains millions of books and academic journals, and access to those resources
                    can require a long walk deep into the library stacks after a consultation with a

                    practice, however, how libraries, businesses, government agencies or other
                    enterprises deal with these problems depends on their budgets and on their
                    technical sophistication. In addition, not every resource should or can always
                    be migrated, and the co-existence of multiple storage technologies makes an

                        components that can be combined as needed. An <abbr class="calibre1">SOA</abbr> enables a
                        business to quickly and cost-effectively change how it does business and
                        whom it does business with (suppliers, business partners, or customers).
                            <abbr class="calibre1">SOA</abbr> is generally implemented using web services that
                        exchange <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> documents in real-time information flows to
                        interconnect the business service components. If the business service
                        components are described abstractly it can be possible for one service
                        provider to be transparently substituted for another

                by <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">anything of value,</span>”</span> exactly? It might seem that the question of
                    <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-1242"><em class="firstterm">identity</em></a></strong></span>, of what a single resource is, should not
                be hard to answer. After all, we live in a world of resources, and
                    <span class="calibre1">finding</span>, <span class="calibre1">selecting</span>,
                    <span class="calibre1">describing</span>, <span class="calibre1">arranging</span>, and
                    <span class="calibre1">referring</span> to them are everyday activities.</p><p class="calibre5">Nevertheless, even when the resources we are dealing with are <span class="calibre1">tangible
                    things</span>, how we go about organizing them is not always obvious, or at
                least not obvious to each of us in the same way at all times. Not everyone thinks of
                them in the same way. Recognizing something in the sense of perceiving it as a
                    <span class="calibre1">tangible thing</span> is only the first step toward being able to
                organize it and other resources like it. Which properties garner our attention, and
                which we use in organizing depends on our experiences, purposes, and context.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">We <span class="calibre1">add information</span> to a resource when we
                        <span class="calibre1">name</span> or <span class="calibre1">describe</span> it; it then becomes more
                    than <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">it.</span>”</span></span>
                <span class="calibre1">We can describe the same resource in many different ways.</span>
                <span class="calibre1">At various times we can consider any given resource to be one of many
                    members of a broad category, as one of the few members of a narrow category, or
                    as a unique instance of a category with only one member.</span> For example,
                we might recognize something as a piece of clothing, as a sock, or as the specific
                dirty sock with the hole worn in the heel from yesterday's long hike. However, even
                after we categorize something, we might not be careful how we talk about it; we
                often refer to two objects as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the same thing</span>”</span> when what we mean is
                that they are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the same type of thing.</span>”</span> Indeed, we could debate whether
                a category with only one possible member is really a category, because it blurs an
                important distinction between particular items or instances and the class or type to
                which they belong.</p><p class="calibre5">The issues that matter and the decisions we need to make about resource instances
                and resource classes and types are not completely separable. Nevertheless, we will
                strive to focus on the former ones in this chapter and the latter ones in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Categories: Describing Resource Classes and

                    single objects, it is even more challenging when the resources are objects or
                    systems composed of other parts. In these cases, we must focus on the entirety
                    of the object or system and treat it as a resource, treat its constituent parts
                    as resources, and deal with the relationships between the parts and the whole,
                    as we do with engineering drawings and assembly procedures.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">How many <span class="calibre1">things</span> is a car?</span> If you are
                    imagining the car being assembled you might think of several dozen large parts
                    like the frame, suspension, drive train, gas tank, brakes, engine, exhaust
                    system, passenger compartment, doors, and other pre-assembled components. Of
                    course, each of those components is itself made up of many parts
                        <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> think of the engine, or even just the radio. Some
                    sources have counted ten or fifteen thousand parts in the average car, and but
                    even at that precise granularity a lot of parts are still complex things. There
                    are screws and wires and fasteners and on and on; really too many to
                    count.</p><p class="calibre5">Ambiguity about the number of parts in the whole holds for information
                    resources too; a newspaper can be considered a single resource but it might also
                    consist of multiple sections, each of which contains separate stories, each of
                    which has many paragraphs, and so on. <span class="calibre1">From the typesetter's point of
                        view, each character in a sentence can be taken as a distinct resource,
                        selected from a font of similar resources.</span></p></div><div class="book" title="3.1.1.2 Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and Smart Things as Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-985" class="firstname"></a>3.1.1.2 Bibliographic Resources, Information Components, and <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Smart

                        <span class="calibre1">identification</span> and <span class="calibre1">description</span> because
                    their most important property is usually their content, which is not easily and
                    consistently recognizable. <span class="calibre1">Organizing systems for information resources
                        in physical form, like those for libraries, have to juggle the duality of
                        their tangible embodiment with what is inherently an abstract information
                        resource; that is, the printed book versus the knowledge the book
                        contains.</span> Here, the organizing system emphasizes description
                    resources or surrogates, like bibliographic records that describe the
                    information content, rather than their physical properties.</p><p {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="jp" class="calibre5">Another important question in libraries is: <span class="calibre1">What set of
                        resources should be treated as the same work because they contain
                        essentially similar intellectual or artistic content?</span> We may talk
                    about Shakespeare's play <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em>, but what is this thing
                    we call <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Macbeth</span>”</span>? Is it a particular string of words, saved in a
                    computer file or handwritten upon a folio? Is it the collection of words printed
                    with some predetermined font and pagination? Are all the editions and printings
                    of these words the same <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em>? How should we organize
                    the numerous live and recorded performances of plays and movies that share the
                        <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em> name? What about creations based on or
                    inspired by <em class="firstterm">Macbeth</em> that do not share the title

                        distinguishes it from other resources, which we call the resource <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-889"><em class="firstterm">domain</em></a></strong></span>.</span> Domain is an intuitive
                    notion that we can help define by contrasting it with the alternative of
                        <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="firstterm">ad hoc</em></span> or arbitrary groupings of
                    resources that just happen to be in the same place at some moment, rather than
                    being based on natural or intrinsic characteristics.</span></p><p class="calibre5">For <span class="calibre1">physical resources</span>, domains can be coarsely distinguished
                according to the <span class="calibre1">type of matter</span> of which they are made using
                properties that can be readily perceived. <span class="calibre1">All languages and cultures make
                    basic contrasts between animal, vegetable, or material substances and then make
                    further distinctions to create a hierarchical system of domain
                    categories.</span>
                <span class="calibre1">Many aspects of this system of domain categories are determined by natural
                    constraints on category membership that are manifested in patterns of shared
                    properties; once a resource is identified as a member of one category it must
                    also be a member of another with which it shares some but not all
                    properties.</span> For example, a marble statue in a museum must also be a
                kind of material resource, and a fish in an aquarium must also be a kind of animal
                resource.</p><p class="calibre5">For information resources, easily perceived properties are less reliable and
                correlated, so we more often distinguish domains based on semantic properties; the
                definitions of the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">encyclopedia,</span>”</span>
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">novel,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">invoice</span>”</span> resource types distinguish them
                according to their typical subject matter, or the type of content, rather than
                according to the great variety of physical forms in which we might encounter them.
                Arranging <span class="calibre1">books</span> by color or size might be sensible for very
                small collections, or in a photo studio, but organizing according to physical
                properties would make it extremely impractical to find books in a large
                library.</p><p class="calibre5">We can arrange types of information resources in a hierarchy but because the
                category boundaries are not sharp it is more useful to view domains of information
                resources on a continuum from weakly-structured narrative content to highly
                structured transactional content. This <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-181"><em class="firstterm">framework</em></a>, called the <em class="firstterm">Document Type Spectrum</em>
                by Glushko and McGrath, captures the idea that the boundaries between resource
                domains, like those between colors in the rainbow, are easy to see for colors far
                apart in the spectrum but hard to see for adjacent ones.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1335" href="#calibre_link-1252" class="calibre1">123</a>]</sup> See the Sidebar, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-791" title="The Document Type Spectrum">The Document Type Spectrum</a>,</span>”</span>

                    extent to which their content is semantically prescribed, by the amount of
                    internal structure, and by the correlations of their presentation and formatting
                    to their content and structure. These three characteristics of content,
                    structure, and presentation vary systematically from narrative document types
                    like novels to transactional document types like invoices.</p><p class="calibre5">Narrative types are authored by people and are heterogeneous in structure and
                    content, and their content is usually just prose and graphic elements. Their
                    presentational characteristics carefully reinforce their structure and
                    semantics; for example, the text of titles or major headings is large because
                    the content is important, in contrast to the small text of footnotes.
                    Transactional document types are usually created mechanically and, as a result,
                    are homogeneous in structure and content; their content is largely
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">data</span>”</span> -- strongly typed content with precise semantics that
                    can be processed by computers.</p><p class="calibre5">In the middle of the spectrum are hybrid document types like textbooks,
                    encyclopedias, and technical manuals that contain a mixture of narrative text
                    and structured content in figures, data tables, code examples, and so on.</p></div><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-1253" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2261" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000024.jpg" alt="Document Type Spectrum" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;3-2.&nbsp;Document Type Spectrum</p></div></div><div class="book" title="3.2.2 Resource Format"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-1229" class="firstname"></a>3.2.2 Resource Format</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">Information resources can exist in numerous formats with the most basic

                surrogates for the <span class="calibre1">physical resources</span> to overcome the
                constraints posed by their physical properties. When we <span class="calibre1">search</span> for

                belongs, and deciding which of those categories is appropriate to emphasize. Most of
                the time we carry out these tasks in an automatic, unconscious way; at other times
                we make conscious decisions about them. For some purposes we consider a sports team
                as a single resource, as a collection of separate players for others, as offense and
                defense, as starters and reserves, and so on.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1356" href="#calibre_link-1278" class="calibre1">144</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Although we have many choices about how we can organize football players, all of

                Panizzi wondered: How do we differentiate similar objects in a library catalog? His
                solution was a catalog organized by author name with an index of subjects, along
                with his newly concocted <em class="firstterm">Rules for the Compilation of the
                    Catalogue</em>. This contained 91 rules about how to identify and arrange
                author names and titles and what to do with anonymous works. The Rules were meant to
                codify how to differentiate and describe each singular resource in his library.
                Taken together, the rules serve to group all the different editions and versions of
                a work together under a single identity.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1358" href="#calibre_link-1280" class="calibre1">146</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">The concept of identity for bibliographic resources was refined in the 1950s by
                Lubetzky, who enlarged the concept of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the work</span>”</span> to make it a more
                abstract idea of an author's intellectual or artistic creation. According to
                Lubetzky's principle, an audio book, a video recording of a play, and an electronic
                book should be listed each as distinct items, yet still linked to the original
                because of their overlapping intellectual origin.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1359" href="#calibre_link-1281" class="calibre1">147</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-375" class="calibre1"></a>The distinctions put forth by Lubetzky,

                exchanged in documents, records, messages, or resource descriptions of some kind.
                Information components are the primitive and abstract resources in
                information-intensive domains. They are the units of meaning that serve as building
                blocks of composite descriptions and other information artifacts.</p><p class="calibre5">The value creation processes in information-intensive domains work best when their
                component parts come from a common <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-99"><em class="firstterm">controlled vocabulary</em></a> for components, or when each uses a
                vocabulary with a granularity and semantic precision compatible with the others. For
                example, the value created by a personal health record emerges when information from
                doctors, clinics, hospitals, and insurance companies can be combined because they
                all share the same <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">patient</span>”</span> component as a logical piece of
                information.</p><p class="calibre5">This abstract definition of information components does not help identify them, so
                we will introduce some heuristic criteria: An <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">information component</span>”</span>
                can be (1) Any piece of information that has a unique label or identifier or (2) Any
                piece of information that is self-contained and comprehensible on its own.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1361" href="#calibre_link-1286" class="calibre1">149</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">These two criteria for determining the identity of information components are
                often easy to satisfy through observations, interviews, and task analysis because
                people naturally use many different types of information and talk easily about
                specific components and the documents that contain them. Some common components
                (e.g., person, location, date, item) and familiar document types (e.g., report,
                catalog, calendar, receipt) can be identified in almost any domain. Other components
                need to be more precisely defined to meet the more specific semantic requirements of
                narrower domains. These smaller or more fine-grained components might be viewed as
                refined or qualified versions of the generic components and document types, like
                course grade and semester components in academic transcripts, airport codes and
                flight numbers in travel itineraries and tickets, and drug names and dosages in
                prescriptions.</p><p class="calibre5">Decades of practical and theoretical effort in conceptual modeling, relational
                theory, and database design have resulted in rigorous methods for identifying
                information components when requirements and business rules for information can be
                precisely specified. For example, in the domain of business transactions, required
                information like item numbers, quantities, prices, payment information, and so on
                must be encoded as a particular type of data<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>integer,
                decimal, Unicode string, etc.<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span> with clearly defined possible
                values and that follows clear occurrence rules.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1362" href="#calibre_link-1287" class="calibre1">150</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Identifying components can seem superficially easy at the transactional end of the
                Document Type Spectrum (see Sidebar in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-609" title="3.2.1 Resource Domain">3.2.1 Resource Domain</a>), with orders
                or invoices, forms requiring data entry, or other highly-structured document types
                like product catalogs, where pieces of information are typically labeled and
                delimited by boxes, lines, white space or other presentation features that encode
                the distinctions between types of content. For example, the presence of ITEM,
                CUSTOMER NAME, ADDRESS, and PAYMENT INFORMATION labels on the fields of an online
                order form suggests these pieces of information are semantically distinct components
                in a retail application. They follow the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">self-contained and
                    comprehensible</span>”</span> heuristic enough to interconnect the order management,
                payment, and delivery services that work together to carry out the transaction. In
                addition, these labels might have analogues in variable names in the source code
                that implements the order form, or as tags in a <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> document
                created by the ordering application; <code class="literal">&lt;CustName&gt;</code>John Smith<code class="literal">&lt;/CustName&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;Item&gt;</code>A-19<code class="literal">&lt;/Item&gt;</code> in the
                order document can be easily identified when it is sent to the other services by the
                order management application.</p><p class="calibre5">But the theoretically grounded methods for identifying components like those of
                relational theory and normalization that work for structured data do not strictly
                apply when information requirements are more qualitative and less precise at the
                narrative end of the Document Type Spectrum. These information requirements are
                typical of narrative, unstructured and semi-structured types of documents, and
                information sources like those often found in law, education, and professional
                services. Narrative documents include technical publications, reports, policies,
                procedures and other less structured information, where semantic components are
                rarely labeled explicitly and are often surrounded by text that is more generic.
                Unlike transactional documents that depend on precise semantics because they are
                used by computers, narrative documents are used by people, who can ask if they
                aren't sure what something means, so there is less need to explicitly define the
                meaning of the information components. Occasional exceptions, such as where
                components in narrative documents are identified with explicit labels like NOTE and
                WARNING, only prove the rule.</p></div><div class="book" title="3.3.4 Identity and Active Resources and Smart Things"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-1234" class="firstname"></a>3.3.4 Identity and Active Resources and <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Smart Things</span>”</span></h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-497"><em class="firstterm">Active resources</em></a> (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-927" title="3.4.3.2 Reduce Synonymy and Homonymy with Controlled Vocabularies">3.4.3.2 Reduce Synonymy and Homonymy with Controlled Vocabularies</a>) initiate effects or create value on their own.

                is one that uses point-of-sale transaction information created when items are

                difficult as the amount of data grows, because a one in million event might be a

                outliers in a billion sensor readings, this cluster of data probably reveals
                something important. On the other hand, giving every sensor the computing capability
                to refine its data so that it only communicates significant information might make
                the sensors too expensive to deploy.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1366" href="#calibre_link-1291" class="calibre1">154</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="book" title="3.4 Naming Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-878" class="firstname"></a>3.4 Naming Resources</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Determining the identity of the thing, document, information component, or data item

                    directory). A consequence of this bias is that people or resources with names
                    that begin with letters late in the alphabet are systematically discriminated
                    against because they are often not considered, or because they are evaluated in

For example, a name like that of <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Johann</span> <span class="calibre1">Wolfgang</span> <span class="calibre1">von Goëthe</span></span> might be alphabetized as both a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">G</span>”</span> name and a

                    variations to the authoritative name. Similar rules are followed for identifying

                    outcome of persistence.</p><p class="calibre5">The subtle relationship between preservation and persistence raises some
                    interesting questions about what it means for a resource to stay the same over
                    time. One way to think of persistence is that a persistent resource is never
                    changed. However, physical resources often require maintenance, repair, or
                    restoration to keep them accessible and usable, and we might question whether at
                    some point these activities have transformed them into different
                        resources.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1392" href="#calibre_link-1326" class="calibre1">180</a>]</sup> Likewise, digital resources require regular backup and migration to
                    keep them available and this might include changing their digital format.</p><p class="calibre5">We might instead think of persistence more abstractly, and expect that
                    persistent resources need only to remain functionally the same to support the
                    same interactions at any point in their lifetimes even if their physical
                    properties change. Active resources implemented as computational agents or web
                    services might be re-implemented numerous times, but as long as they don't
                    change their interfaces they can be deemed to be persistent from the perspective
                    of any other resource that uses them. Similarly, many resources like online
                    newspapers or blog feeds continually change their content but still could have
                    persistent identifiers.</p><p class="calibre5">Some <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                        systems</em></a> closely monitor their resources and every interaction

                    changes. Some <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                        systems</em></a>, like those for software or legal documents, explicitly
                    maintain every changed version to satisfy expectations of persistence because
                    different users might not be relying on the same version. With digital resources
                    determining whether two resources are the same or determining how they are
                    related or derived from one another are very challenging problems.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1393" href="#calibre_link-1327" class="calibre1">181</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="book" title="3.5.2 Effectivity"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-1238" class="firstname"></a>3.5.2 Effectivity</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-365" class="calibre1"></a>Many resources, or their properties, also have

                    they come into effect at a particular time and will almost certainly cease to be
                    effective at some future date. Effectivity is sometimes known as time-to-live
                    and it is generally expressed as a range of two dates. It consists of a date on
                    which the resource is effective, and optionally a date on which the resource
                    ceases to be effective, or becomes stale.</span> For some types of resources,
                the effective date is the moment they are created, but for others, the effective
                date can be a time different from the moment of creation. For example, a law can be
                passed in November but not take effect until January 1 of the following year. An
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">effective date</span>”</span> is the counterpart of the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Best
                    Before</span>”</span> date on perishable goods. That date indicates when a product goes
                bad, whereas an item's effective date is when it <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">goes good</span>”</span> and the
                resource that it supersedes needs to be disposed of or archived.</p><p class="calibre5">Effectivity concerns sometimes intersect with name authority control, because name
                changes for resources often are tied to particular dates and events. Some places
                that have been the site of civil unrest, foreign occupation, and other political
                disruptions have had many different names over time. Even if you always live in the
                same place, the answer to <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what country do you live in?</span>”</span> can depend on
                when it is asked.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-1394" href="#calibre_link-1328" class="calibre1">182</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">In most cases effectivity implies persistence requirements because it is important
                to be able to determine and reconstruct the configuration of resources that was in

                technologists are more skeptical of them because they can imagine ways for them to

                        produces a set of tightly defined information components that have minimal
                        redundancy and ambiguity. Imagine that a business keeps information about
                        customer orders using a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">spreadsheet</span>”</span> style of organization in
                        which a row contains cells that record the date, order number, customer
                        name, customer address, item ID, item description, quantity, unit price, and
                        total price. If an order contains multiple products, these would be recorded
                        on additional rows, as would subsequent orders from the same customer. All
                        of this information is important to the business, but this way of organizing
                        it has a great deal of redundancy and inefficiency. For example, the
                        customer address recurs in every order, and the customer address field
                        merges street, city, state and zip code into a large unstructured field
                        rather than separating them as atomic components of different types of
                        information with potentially varying uses. Similar redundancy exists for the
                        products and prices. Cancelling an order might result in the business
                        deleting all the information it has about a particular customer or product. </p><p class="calibre5">Normalization divides this large body of information into four separate

                the other to take on a name that describes their marital relationship. Historically,
                in many parts of the English-speaking world, married women have often referred to
                themselves using their husband's name; when <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Jane</span> <span class="calibre1">Smith</span></span> married <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">John</span> <span class="calibre1">Brown</span></span>, her name became <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Jane</span> <span class="calibre1">Brown</span></span> or <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Mrs.</span>. <span class="calibre1">John</span> <span class="calibre1">Brown</span></span>.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-962" href="#calibre_link-870" class="calibre1">188</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">Every resource can be given a name or identifier. Identifiers are
                    especially efficient resource descriptions because, by definition, identifiers
                    are unique over some domain or collection of resources. Names and identifiers do
                    not typically describe the resource in any ordinary sense because they are
                    usually assigned to the resource rather than recording a property of
                    it.</span></p><p class="calibre5">However, the arbitrariness of names and identifiers means that they do not serve
                to distinguish resources for people who do not already know them. This is why we use
                what linguists call referring expressions or definite descriptions, like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the
                    small black dog</span>”</span> rather than the more efficient <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Blackie,</span>”</span>

                resource, such as a particular book or document, we query for it using its name, or
                other specific information we know about it, to increase the likelihood that we can
                find it. In contrast, when we are looking for resources to satisfy an information
                need but do not have specific resources in mind, we query for them using
                descriptions of their content or other properties. In general, information retrieval
                can be characterized as comparing the description of a user's needs with
                descriptions of the resources that might satisfy them.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.2.2 Description as an Inclusive Term"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-854" class="firstname"></a>4.2.2 <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Description</span>”</span> as an Inclusive Term</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Up to now we have used the concept of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">description</span>”</span> without defining
                it because we have most often used it in its ordinary sense to mean the visible or
                important features that characterize or represent something. However, the concept is
                sometimes used more precisely in the context of organizing systems, where resource
                description is often more formal, systematic, and institutional. For example, in the
                library science context of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">bibliographic description,</span>”</span> a
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">descriptor</span>”</span> is one of the terms in a carefully designed language
                that can be assigned to a resource to designate its properties, characteristics, or
                meaning, or its relationships with other resources. In the contexts of conceptual
                modeling and information systems design, the terms in resource descriptions are also
                called keywords, index terms, attributes, attribute values, elements, data elements,
                data values, or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the vocabulary.</span>”</span> In contexts where descriptions are
                less formal or more personal the description terms are often called labels or tags.
                Rather than attempt to make fine distinctions among these synonyms or near-synonyms,
                we will use <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">description</span>”</span> as an inclusive term except where
                conventional usage overwhelmingly favors one of the other terms.</p><p class="calibre5">All of these terms come from a relatively narrow semantic scope in which the
                purpose of description is to identify and characterize the essence, or <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-581"><em class="firstterm">aboutness</em></a>, of a resource. This leaves out
                many kinds of information that can be associated with a resource to support
                additional purposes; for example, information that specifies access controls or
                possible uses of the resource, or information about actual uses. We will describe
                many of these purposes and the types of information needed to enable them in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-856" title="4.3.2 Determining the Purposes of Resource Description">4.3.2 Determining the Purposes of Resource Description</a>, and we use <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">resource description</span>”</span> in an
                expansive way to accommodate all of them.</p><p class="calibre5"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;3</a> introduced the distinction of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-872" title="3.2.4 Resource Focus">3.2.4 Resource Focus</a></span>”</span> to contrast primary resources with
                resources that describe them, which we called Description Resources. We chose this
                term as a more inclusive and more easily understood alternative to two terms that

                    as a structured record in a standardized format that describes a specific
                    resource. The earliest bibliographic records in the nineteenth century were
                    those in book catalogs, which organized for each author a list of his authored
                    books, with separate entries for each edition and physical copy. Relationships
                    between books by different authors were described using cross-references.</p><p class="calibre5">The nature and extent of bibliographic descriptions were highly constrained by

                    description a highly localized one because every library or collection of
                    resources created its own catalog. The adoption of <span class="calibre1">printed
                        cards</span> as the unit of organization for bibliographic descriptions
                    around the turn of the twentieth century made it easier to maintain the catalog,

                    descriptions for online use was not a straightforward task because the

                    descriptions of classes or collections of resources rather than descriptions of
                    individual resources. The earliest metadata resources, called data dictionaries,
                    documented the arrangement and content of data fields in the records used by
                    transactional applications on mainframe computers. A more sophisticated type of
                    metadata emerged as the documentation of the data models in database management
                    systems, called database schemas, which described the structure of relational
                    tables, attribute names, and legal data types and values for content.</p><p class="calibre5">In 1986, the <em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-1881" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Standard Generalized Markup

                    to (the web page of) a school they attended. Values can be resources too, but
                    they do not have to be: when a property takes simple values like numbers, dates,
                    or text strings, these values do not have URIs and so are not resources.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1872" class="calibre1"></a>Because <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr> uses <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr>s to identify

                format (an exchange format for library catalog records), which contains many fields
                about the bibliographic characteristics of an object like author, title, publication
                year, publisher, and pagination. An alternate framework for resource description
                focuses on each individual description or assertion about a single resource. This
                statement at a time view of resource is more typical when descriptions are assigned
                to web objects or resources, and much of the discussion about this view is framed in
                terms of the particular syntactic forms being used in <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr>.</p><p class="calibre5">In either case, these common ways of thinking about resource description emphasize
                    <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> or perhaps even overemphasize - two implementation
                decisions. The first is whether to combine multiple resource descriptions into a
                structural package or to keep them as separate descriptive statements. The second is
                the choice of syntax in which the descriptions are encoded.</p><p class="calibre5">Both of these implementation decisions have important implications, but are
                secondary to the questions about the purposes of resource description, how resource
                properties are selected as the basis for description, how they are best created, and
                other logical or design considerations. In keeping with the fundamental idea of the
                discipline of organizing (introduced in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-161" title="1.2.3.1 The Concept of Organizing Principle">1.2.3.1 The Concept of Organizing Principle</a>), it is

                contrast to our view that treats resource description as a more inclusive category.
                In addition, these classifications do not always distinguish between intrinsic and

                    common to all organizing systems: selecting, organizing, interacting with, and
                    maintaining resources, as we saw in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-27" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. The particular
                    resource domain and the context in which descriptions are created and used
                    imposes more specific requirements and constraints on the purposes that resource
                    description can serve;</p></li><li class="listitem" title="Identifying Resource Properties"><p class="calibre5">Identifying Resource Properties</p><p class="calibre5">Once the purposes of description in terms of activities and interactions have
                    been determined, the specific properties of the resources that are needed to
                    enable them can be identified. The contrasts between intrinsic and extrinsic
                    properties, and between static and dynamic properties, are useful to identify
                    appropriate resource properties;</p></li><li class="listitem" title="Designing the Description Vocabulary"><p class="calibre5">Designing the Description Vocabulary</p><p class="calibre5">This step includes several logical and semantic decisions about how the
                    resource properties will be described. What terms or element names should be
                    used to identify the resource properties we have chosen to describe? Are there
                    rules or constraints on the types of data or values that the property
                    descriptions can assume? A good description vocabulary will be easy to assign
                    when creating resource descriptions and easy to understand when using
                    them;</p></li><li class="listitem" title="Designing the Description Form and Implementation"><p class="calibre5">Designing the Description Form and Implementation</p><p class="calibre5">The logical and semantic decisions about the description vocabulary are
                    reified by decisions about the notation, syntax and structure of the
                    descriptions. Taken together, these decisions collectively determine what we
                    call the <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">form</strong></span> or <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">encoding</strong></span> of the resource descriptions. The implementation of the
                    descriptions involves decisions about how and where they are stored and the
                    technology used to create, edit, store, and retrieve them;</p></li><li class="listitem" title="Creating the Descriptions"><p class="calibre5">Creating the Descriptions</p><p class="calibre5">Resource descriptions are created by individuals, by informal or formal groups
                    of people, or by automated or computational means. Some types of descriptions
                    can only be created by people, some types of descriptions can only be created by
                    automated or algorithmic techniques, and some can be created in either
                    manner;</p></li><li class="listitem" title="Evaluating the Descriptions"><p class="calibre5">Evaluating the Descriptions</p><p class="calibre5">The resource descriptions must be evaluated with respect to their intended
                    purposes. The results of this evaluation will help determine which or the
                    preceding steps need to be redone.</p></li></ol></div><p class="calibre5">How explicit and systematic each step needs to be depends on the resource scope and
            domain, and especially on the intended users of the organizing system. If we look
            carefully, we can see most of these steps taking place even in very informal contexts,
            like the kids playing with Lego blocks with which we started this chapter. The goal of
            building things with the blocks leads the boys to identify which properties are most
            useful to analyze. They develop descriptions of the blocks that capture the specific
            values of the relevant properties. Finally, they evaluate their descriptions by using
            them when they play together; it becomes immediately obvious that a description is not
            serving its purpose when one boy hands a block to another that was not the one he
            thought he had asked for.</p><p class="calibre5">In contrast, the picture-taking scenario involves a much more explicit and systematic
            process of resource description. The resource properties, description vocabulary, and
            description form used automatically by the digital camera were chosen by an industry
            association and published as a technical specification implemented by camera and mobile
            phone manufacturers worldwide. If a professional photographer is taking the photo for
            commercial purposes, many of the other descriptions assigned to the image to identify
            ownership, rights management and syndication are likely to conform to formal
            specifications and be managed in institutional information systems.</p><p class="calibre5">The resource descriptions used by libraries, archives, and museums are typically
            created in an even more explicit and systematic manner. Like the descriptions of the
            digital photo, the properties, vocabulary, and form of the descriptions used by their
            organizing systems are governed by standards. However, there is no equivalent to the
            digital camera that can create these descriptions automatically. Instead, highly trained
            professionals create them meticulously.</p><p class="calibre5">A great many resources and their associated descriptions in business and scientific
            organizing systems are created by automated or computational processes, so the process
            of describing individual resources is not at all like that in libraries and other memory
            institutions. However, the process for designing the data models or schemas for the
            class of resources that will be generated is equally systematic and is typically
            performed by highly skilled data analysts and data modelers.</p><div class="book" title="4.3.1 Determining the Scope and Focus of Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-59" class="firstname"></a>4.3.1 Determining the Scope and Focus of Resource Description</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Which resources do we want to describe? As we saw in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>,
                determining what will be treated as a separate resource is not always easy,
                especially for resources with component parts and for information resources where
                the most important property is their content, which is not directly perceivable.
                Identifying the thing you want to describe as precisely as practical is the first
                step to creating a useful description.</p><p class="calibre5">In <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-872" title="3.2.4 Resource Focus">3.2.4 Resource Focus</a>, we introduced the contrast between primary
                resources and description resources, which we called resource focus. Determining the
                resource focus goes hand in hand with determining which resources we intend to
                describe; these often arbitrary decisions then make a huge difference in the nature
                and extent of resource description. One person's metadata is another person's data.
                For a librarian, the price of a <span class="calibre1">book</span> might be just one more
                attribute that is part of the book's record. For an accountant at a bookstore, the
                price of that book<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>both the cost to buy the book and the
                price at which it is then sold to customers<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>is critical
                information for staying in business. A scientist studying comparative anatomy
                preserves <span class="calibre1">animal specimens</span> and records detailed
                    <span class="calibre1">physical descriptions</span> about them, but a scientist studying
                ecology or migration discards the specimens and focuses on describing the context in
                which the specimen was located.</p><div class="book" title="4.3.1.1 Granularity – Describing Instances or Describing Collections"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1577" class="firstname"></a>4.3.1.1 Granularity <span class="firstname">&ndash;</span> Describing Instances or
                    Describing Collections</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">It is simplest to think of a resource description as being associated with
                    another individual resource. However, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, it can be challenging to determine what to treat as an individual resource
                    when resources are themselves objects or systems that are composed of other
                    parts or resources. For example, we sometimes describe a football team as a
                    single resource and at other times we focus on each individual player. However,
                    after we have decided on resource granularity, the question remains whether each
                    resource needs a separate description.</p><p class="calibre5">Libraries and museums specialize in curating resource descriptions about the
                    instances in their collections. Resource descriptions are also applied to
                    classes or collections of resources (because a collection is also a resource;
                    see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-159" title="1.2.2 The Concept of Collection">1.2.2 The Concept of Collection</a>). Archives and <span class="calibre1">special collections
                        of maps</span> are typically assigned resource descriptions, but each
                    document or map contained in the collection does not necessarily have its own
                    bibliographic description. Similarly, business and scientific data sets are
                    invariably described at collection-level granularity because they are often
                    analyzed in their entirety.</p><p class="calibre5">Furthermore, the granularity of description for a collection of resources
                    tends to differ for different users or purposes. Consider the information
                    systems that commodity traders use to access descriptions of real
                        <span class="calibre1">resources in markets</span> all over the world: some traders
                    are concerned with weekly production in their region, while others are
                    monitoring real-time global flows of <span class="calibre1">precious metals</span> and
                        <span class="calibre1">petroleum products</span>. Many web pages, especially
                    e-commerce product catalogs and news sites, are dynamically assembled and
                    personalized from a large number of information resources and services that are
                    separately identified and described in content management and content delivery
                    systems. However, a highly complex collection of resources that comes together
                    in a single page is treated as a single resource when that page appears in a
                    list of search engine results. Moreover, all of the thousands of separately
                    generated pages can be given a single description when a user creates a bookmark
                    to make it easy to return to the home page of the site.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-697" class="firstname"></a>4.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">We can also associate resource descriptions with an entire type or domain of
                    resources (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-892" title="2.5.2.3 Preserving Resource Types">2.5.2.3 Preserving Resource Types</a> and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-609" title="3.2.1 Resource Domain">3.2.1 Resource Domain</a>). A collection of resource descriptions is vastly
                    more useful when every resource is described using common description elements
                    or terms that apply to every resource. The specification of the set of
                    descriptions that apply to an entire resource type is called a schema, model, or
                    metadata standard. Sometimes this schema, model, or standard is inferred from or
                    imposed on a collection of existing resources to ensure more consistent
                    definitions, but more often, it is used as a specification when the resources
                    are created or generated in the first place (See <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-893" title="What about Creating Resources?">What about Creating Resources?</a></span>”</span> in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-894" title="2.1 Four Activities in All Organizing Systems">2.1 Four Activities in All Organizing Systems</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">A <span class="calibre1">relational database</span>, for example, is easily
                    conceptualized as a collection of records organized as a table, with each record
                    in its own row having a number of fields or attributes that contain some
                    prescribed type of content. Each record or row in the database table is a
                    description of a resource <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> an employee, a product,
                    anything <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> and the individual attribute values, organized
                    by the columns and rows of the table, are distinct parts of the description for
                    some particular resource instance, like employee 24 or product 8012C.</p><p class="calibre5">Because the relational database schema serves as a model for the creation of
                    resource descriptions, it is designed to restrict the descriptions to be simple
                    and completely regular sets of attribute-value pairs. The database schema
                    specifies the overall structure of the table and especially its columns, which
                    will contain the attribute values that describe each resource. An employee table
                    might have columns for the attributes of employee ID, hiring date, department,
                    and salary. A date attribute will be restricted to a value that is a date, while
                    an employee salary will be restricted according to salary ranges established by
                    the human resources department. This makes the name of the attribute and the
                    constraints on attribute values into resource descriptions that apply to the
                    entire class of resources described by the table.</p><p class="calibre5">The information resources that we commonly call documents are, by their
                    nature, less homogeneous in content and structure than those that can be managed
                    in databases. Document schemas, commonly represented in <abbr class="calibre1">SGML</abbr> or
                        <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>, usually allow for a mixture of data-like and textual
                    descriptive elements. <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> schema languages have greatly
                    improved on <abbr class="calibre1">SGML</abbr> and <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> by expressing the
                    description of the document schema in <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> itself, using the
                    same syntax as the resource it describes, making it easy to create resources
                    using the metadata as a template or pattern. As a result, <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>
                    schemas are often used as the specifications for <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> resources
                    created and used by information-intensive applications; in this context, they
                    are often called <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> vocabularies. <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> schemas
                    are often used to define web forms that capture resource instances (each
                    filled-out form). <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> schemas are also used to describe the
                    interfaces to web services and other computational resources.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-976" href="#calibre_link-895" class="calibre1">202</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">It is often necessary to associate some descriptions with individual resources
                    that are specific to that instance and other kinds of descriptions that reflect
                    the abstract class to which the instance belongs. When <span class="calibre1">a typical
                        car</span> comes off the assembly line, it has only one instance-level
                    description that differentiates it from its peers: its <span class="calibre1">vehicle
                        identification number</span> (<abbr class="calibre1">VIN</abbr>). Specific cars have
                    individualized interior and exterior colors and installed options, and they all
                    have a date and location of manufacture. Other description elements have values
                    that are shared with many other cars of the same model and year, like suggested
                    price and the additional option packages, or configurations that can be applied
                    to it before it is delivered to a customer. Alternatively, any descriptive
                    information that applies to multiple cars of the same model year could be part
                    of a resource description at that level that is referred to rather than
                    duplicated in instance descriptions.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-918" class="firstname"></a>4.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">If we only had one thing to describe, we could use a single word to describe
                    it: <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">it</span>”</span>. We would not need to distinguish it from anything else. A
                    second resource implies at least one more term in the description language:
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">not it</span>”</span>. However, as a collection grows, descriptions must
                    become more complex to distinguish not only between, but also among
                    resources.</p><p class="calibre5">Every element or term in a description language creates a dimension, or axis,
                    along which resources can be distinguished, or it defines a set of questions
                    about resources. Distinctions and questions that arise frequently, such as
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what is the name of the resource?</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">who created
                        it?</span>”</span>, or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what type of content or matter does it
                        contain?</span>”</span>, need to be easy to address. Therefore, as a collection
                    grows, the language for describing resources must become more rigorous, and
                    descriptions created when the collection was small often require revision
                    because they are no longer adequate for their intended purposes. The description
                    language typically evolves from a simple list of descriptive terms to a glossary
                    with definitions, to a highly controlled vocabulary with content rules for
                    allowable values, and, finally, to a thesaurus in which each term is also
                    defined with respect to its semantic relationships to other terms that are
                    broader, narrower, or otherwise associated with it.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-977" href="#calibre_link-896" class="calibre1">203</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">This co-evolution of descriptive scope and description complexity is easy to
                    see in the highly complex bibliographic descriptions created by professional
                    cataloguers. The commonly used <em class="firstterm"><abbr class="calibre1">AACR2</abbr></em>
                    cataloguing standards distinguish 11 different categories of resources and

                    standardized at national and international levels, cataloging work is
                    distributed among many describers whose results are shared. This principle of
                    standardization has been the basis of centralized bibliographic description for
                    a century.</p><p class="calibre5">Centralized resource description by skilled professionals works for libraries,
                    but even in the earliest days of the web many library scientists and web
                    authoring futurists recognized that this approach would not scale for describing
                    web resources. In 1995, the <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Dublin Core</span></span> metadata element set with only 15 elements was proposed as a
                    vastly simpler description vocabulary that people not trained as professional
                    cataloguers could use.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-979" href="#calibre_link-898" class="calibre1">205</a>]</sup> Since then, the <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Dublin Core</span></span> initiative has been highly influential in inspiring numerous
                    other communities to create minimalist description vocabularies, often by
                    simplifying vocabularies that had been devised by professionals for use by
                    non-professionals. In this respect, we can also view the <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Dublin Core</span></span> as part of the intellectual foundations for the

                    sometimes be avoided if the ultimate scope and scale of the organizing system is
                    contemplated when it is being created. It would not be smart for a business with
                    customers in six US states to create an address field in its customer database
                    that only handled those six states; a more extensible design would allow for any
                    state or province and include a country code. In general, however, just as there
                    are problems in adapting a simple vocabulary as scope and scale increase,
                    designing and applying resource descriptions that will work for a large and
                    continuously growing collection might seem like too much work when the

                    resource description still shows some bias toward interactions with physical
                    bibliographic resources and the descriptions needed to obtain them. With
                    physical resources, any interactions that take place once the primary resources
                    are obtained are outside the scope of the organizing system because they are not
                    directly supported by it.</p><p class="calibre5">With digital resources, on the other hand, many of the purposes of resource
                    description are realized with the primary resources. These purposes usually
                    involve processing of the resource content and structure: analysis,
                    summarization, visualization, transformation, reuse, mixing, remixing... far too
                    many purposes to list here. The core principle that underlies all of these
                    purposes is that the variety and functions of the interactions with digital
                    resources depends on the richness of their structural, semantic, and format
                    description (See <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-915" title="2.4.2.2 Value Creation with Digital Resources">2.4.2.2 Value Creation with Digital Resources</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">An important difference between interactions with <span class="calibre1">physical
                        resources</span> and those with digital resources is how they use
                    resource descriptions for access control. Resources sometimes have associated
                    security classifications like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Top Secret</span>”</span> that restrict who can
                    learn about their existence or obtain them. Nonetheless, if you get your hands
                    on a <span class="calibre1">top secret printed document</span>, nothing can prevent you
                    from reading it. Similarly, <span class="calibre1">printed resources</span> often have
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">All rights reserved</span>”</span> copyright notices that say that you
                    cannot copy them, but nothing can prevent you from making copies with a
                        <span class="calibre1">copy machine</span>. On the other hand, learning of the
                    existence of a digital resource might be of little value if copyright or
                    licensing restrictions prevent you from obtaining it. Moreover, obtaining a
                    digital resource might be of no value if its content is only available using a
                    password, decryption key, or other resource description that enforces access
                    control directly rather than indirectly like the security
                    classifications.</p><p class="calibre5">Another important difference between <span class="calibre1">physical resources</span>
                    and digital ones is that interactions with the latter are easily recorded. Usage
                    records from session logs, browsing, or downloading activities are resource
                    descriptions that can be tied to payments for using the resources or analyzed to
                    influence the selection and organizing of resources in future
                    interactions.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.2.4.

                    maintenance of specific resource and the collection to which they belong. In
                    particular, technical information about resource formats and technology
                    (software, <span class="calibre1">computers</span>, or other) needed to use the
                    resources, and information needed to ensure resource integrity is often called

                    maintenance activities include version information and effectivity or useful
                    life information. Usage records are also valuable because they enable the
                    identification of resources that are not being accessed, suggesting that they
                    are no longer needed and can thus be safely archived or discarded.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="4.3.3 Identifying Properties for Resource Description"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-857" class="firstname"></a>4.3.3 Identifying Properties for Resource Description</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Once the purposes of description have been established, we need to identify the
                specific properties of the resources that can satisfy those purposes. There are four
                reasons why this task is more difficult than it initially appears.</p><p class="calibre5">First, any particular resource might need many resource descriptions, all of which
                relate to different properties, depending on the interactions to be supported and
                the context in which they take place. Think about how we might describe
                    <span class="calibre1">something as simple as a chair</span>. In your house, you might
                describe your chair based on the room it is in, e.g., <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the kitchen
                    chair.</span>”</span> When you take the same chair to a potluck dinner at a friend's
                house, where all the chairs end up in the kitchen, it becomes <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">my
                    chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the wooden chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the folding
                    chair,</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the black chair with white trim.</span>”</span> Maybe you
                inherited it, so when you talk to your family, you call it <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">grandma's
                    chair.</span>”</span> If you decide to sell it, you will describe it in a way that is
                intended to encourage someone to buy it, as an <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">all-oak antique kitchen chair
                    in mint condition.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">Second, different types of resources need to incorporate different properties in
                their descriptions. For resources in a museum, these might include
                    <span class="calibre1">materials</span> and dimensions of <span class="calibre1">pieces of
                    art</span>; for files and services managed by a network administrator, these
                include access control permissions; for electronic books or
                    <span class="calibre1">DVDs</span>, they would include the digital rights management
                    (<abbr class="calibre1">DRM</abbr>) code that expresses what you can and cannot do with the
                resource.</p><p class="calibre5">Third, as we briefly touched on in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-918" title="4.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description">4.3.1.3 Scope, Scale, and Resource Description</a>, which
                properties participate in resource descriptions depends on who is doing the
                describing. It makes little sense to expect fine-grained distinctions and
                interpretations about properties from people who lack training in the discipline of
                organizing. We will return to this tradeoff in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-84" title="4.3.6 Creating Resource Descriptions">4.3.6 Creating Resource Descriptions</a> and
                again in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-861" title="4.4.1 Describing Museum and Artistic Resources">4.4.1 Describing Museum and Artistic Resources</a>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Describing Museum and Artistic
                    Resources.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">Fourth, what might seem to be the same property at a conceptual level might be
                very different at an implementation level. Many types of resources have a resource
                description that is a surrogate or summary in some respects of the primary resource.
                For <span class="calibre1">photos</span>, <span class="calibre1">paintings</span>, and other resources
                whose appearance is their essence, an appropriate summary description can be a
                smaller, reduced resolution or thumbnail photo of the original. This surrogate is
                simple to create and it is easy for users to understand its relationship to the
                primary resource. On the other hand, distilling a text down to a short summary or
                abstract is a skill unto itself. Time-based resources provide greater challenges for
                summary. Should the summary of a movie be a textual summary of the plot, a
                significant clip from the movie, a video summary, or something else altogether? How
                is a song summarized? Or a poem? Or a tree?</p><p class="calibre5">Two important dimensions for understanding and contrasting resource properties
                used in descriptions and organizing principles are whether the properties are
                intrinsically or extrinsically associated with the resource, and whether the
                properties are static or dynamic. Taken together these two dimensions yield four
                categories of properties., as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-919" title="Figure 4-1. RDF triples arranged into a graph">Figure&nbsp;4-1</a>.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="calibre_link-2292" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2293" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000020.png" alt="image with no caption" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><div class="book" title="4.3.3.1 Intrinsic Static Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1761" class="firstname"></a>4.3.3.1 Intrinsic Static Properties</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Intrinsic or implicit properties are inherent in the resource and can often be
                    directly perceived or experienced. Static properties do not change their values
                    over time. The size, color, shape, weight, material of composition, and texture
                    of natural or manufactured objects are intrinsic and static properties that are
                    often used to describe and organize physical resources. If a particular Lego is
                    blue, it is set apart from all the not-blue Legos; a square Lego is physically
                    different from a round one. When bibliographic resources were exclusively
                    physical, their sizes and their number of pages were common physical properties
                    in their descriptions.</p><p class="calibre5">Intrinsic physical properties are usually just part of resource descriptions.
                    In many cases, physical properties describe only the surface layer of a
                    resource, revealing little about what something is or its original intended
                    purpose, what it means, or when and why it was created. These intrinsic static
                    properties cannot be directly perceived. The author or creator of a resource,
                    the context of its creation, and the duration of a song are other examples of
                    intrinsic and static resource properties.</p><p class="calibre5">Intrinsic descriptions are often extracted or calculated by computational
                    processes. For example, a computer program might calculate the frequency and
                    distribution of words in some particular document. Those statistics about
                    content properties would still be intrinsic descriptions even though an external
                    process creates them. Similarly, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">image signatures</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">audio
                        fingerprints</span>”</span> are intrinsic descriptions (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-135" title="4.4 Describing Non-Text Resources">4.4 Describing Non-Text Resources</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">Some relationships among resources are intrinsic and static, like the
                    parent-child relationship or the sibling relationship between two children with
                    the same parents. Part-whole or compositional relationships for resources with
                    parts, both physical ones like manufactured objects and digital ones like
                    hierarchical documents or databases, are also intrinsic static properties often
                    used in resource descriptions. However, it is better to avoid treating resource
                    relationships as properties, and instead express them syntactically as
                    relations. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-51" title="Chapter 5. Describing Relationships and Structures">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Describing Relationships and
                        Structures,</span>”</span> discusses part-whole and other semantic relationships in
                    great detail.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.3.2 Extrinsic Static Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1762" class="firstname"></a>4.3.3.2 Extrinsic Static Properties</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Extrinsic or explicit properties are assigned to a resource rather than being
                    inherent in it. The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once
                    assigned does not usually change. Arranging resources according to the
                    alphabetical or numerical order of their descriptive identifiers is a common
                    organizing principle. Classification numbers and subject headings assigned to
                    bibliographic resources are extrinsic static properties, as are the serial
                    numbers stamped on or attached to manufactured products.</p><p class="calibre5">For information resources that have a digital form, the properties of their
                    printed or rendered versions might not be intrinsic. Some text formats
                    completely separate content from presentation, and as a result, style sheets can
                    radically change the appearance of a printed document or web page without
                    altering the primary resource in any way. For example, were a different style
                    applied to this paragraph to highlight it in bold or cast in 24-point font, its
                    content would remain the same.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.3.3 Intrinsic Dynamic Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1763" class="firstname"></a>4.3.3.3 Intrinsic Dynamic Properties</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Intrinsic dynamic properties change over time, such as developmental personal
                    characteristics like a person's height and weight, skill proficiency, or
                    intellectual capacity. Because these properties are not static, they are usually
                    employed only to organize resources whose membership in the collection is of
                    limited duration. Sports programs or leagues that segregate participants by age
                    or years of experience are using intrinsic dynamic properties to describe and
                    organize the resources.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.3.4 Extrinsic Dynamic Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1764" class="firstname"></a>4.3.3.4 Extrinsic Dynamic Properties</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Extrinsic dynamic properties are in many ways arbitrary and can change because
                    they are based on usage, behavior, or context. The current owner or location of
                    a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with other
                    resources, its current popularity or cultural salience, or its competitive
                    advantage over alternative resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic
                    properties that are used in resource descriptions. A topical book described as a
                    best seller one year might be found in the discount sales bin a few years later.
                    A student's grade point average is an extrinsic dynamic property.</p><p class="calibre5">Many relationships between resources are extrinsic and dynamic properties,
                    like that of best friend.</p><p class="calibre5">Resources are often described with <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-920"><em class="firstterm">cultural properties</em></a></strong></span> that derive from
                    conventional language or culture, often by analogy, because they can be highly
                    evocative and memorable.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-993" href="#calibre_link-921" class="calibre1">218</a>]</sup> For the <span class="calibre1">Lego</span> boys familiar with the

                    implementing any principle requires many additional and specific
                    context-dependent choices for which the general principle offers little
                    guidance. For example, how does the principle of Standardization apply if
                    multiple standards already exist in some resource domain? Which of the competing
                    standards should be adopted, and why? The second challenge is that the general
                    principles can sometimes lead to conflicting advice. The User Convenience
                    recommendation to choose description terms in common use fails if the user
                    community includes both ordinary people and scientists who use different terms
                    for the same resources; whose <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">common usage</span>”</span> should prevail?</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.4.2 Who Uses the Descriptions?"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1811" class="firstname"></a>4.3.4.2 Who Uses the Descriptions?</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Focus on the user of the descriptions. This is a core idea that we cannot
                    overemphasize because it is implicit in every step of the process of resource
                    description. All of the design principles in the previous section share the idea
                    that the design of the description vocabulary should focus on the user of the
                    descriptions. Are the resources being organized personal ones, for personal and
                    mostly private purposes? In that case, the description properties and terms can
                    be highly personal or idiosyncratic and still follow the design
                    principles.</p><p class="calibre5">Similarly, when resource users share relevant knowledge, or are in a context
                    where they can communicate and negotiate, if necessary, to identify the
                    resources, their resource descriptions can afford to be less precise and
                    rigorous than they might otherwise need to be. This helps explain the curious
                    descriptions in the <span class="calibre1">Lego</span> story with which we began
                    this chapter. The boys playing with the blocks were talking to each other with
                    the <span class="calibre1">Legos</span> in front of them. If they had not been able to
                    see the blocks the others were talking about, or if they had to describe their
                    toys to someone who had never played with <span class="calibre1">Legos</span> before,
                    their descriptions would have been quite different.</p><p class="calibre5">More often, however, resource descriptions can not assume this degree of
                    shared context and must be designed for user categories rather than individual
                    users: library users searching for books, business employees or customers using
                    part and product catalogs, scientists analyzing the datasets from experiments or
                    simulations. In each of these situations resource descriptions will need to be
                    understood by people who did not create them, so the design of the description
                    vocabulary needs to be more deliberate and systematic to ensure that its terms
                    are unambiguous and sufficient to ensure reliable context-free interpretation. A
                    single individual seldom has the breadth of domain knowledge and experience with
                    users needed to devise a description vocabulary that can satisfy diverse users
                    with diverse purposes. Instead, many people working together typically develop
                    the required description vocabulary. We call the results institutional
                    vocabularies, to contrast them with individual or cultural ones (We will discuss
                    this contrast more fully in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">Some resource descriptions are designed to be used by computers or other
                    machines, which seemingly reduces the importance of design principles that
                    consider user preferences or common uses. However, the Standardization and
                    Integration principles become more important for inter-machine communication
                    because they enable efficient processing, reuse of data and software, and
                    increased interoperability between organizing systems.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-997" href="#calibre_link-926" class="calibre1">222</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.4.3 Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1812" class="firstname"></a>4.3.4.3 Controlled Vocabularies and Content Rules</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">As we defined in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-927" title="3.4.3.2 Reduce Synonymy and Homonymy with Controlled Vocabularies">3.4.3.2 Reduce Synonymy and Homonymy with Controlled Vocabularies</a>, a <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-99"><em class="firstterm">controlled

                    allowed terms; a thesaurus is a set of terms arranged in a hierarchy and
                    annotated to indicate terms that are preferred, broader than, or narrower than
                    other terms; an ontology expresses the conceptual relationships among the terms
                    in a formal logic-based language so they can be processed by computers. We will
                    say more about ontologies in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-51" title="Chapter 5. Describing Relationships and Structures">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Describing

                    similar to controlled vocabularies because they also limit the possible values
                    that can be used in descriptions. Instead of specifying a fixed set of values,
                    content rules typically restrict descriptions by requiring them to be of a
                    particular data type (integer, Boolean, Date, and so on). Possible values are
                    constrained by logical expressions (e.g., a value must be between 0 and 99) or
                    regular expressions (e.g., must be a string of length 5 that must begin with a
                    number). Content rules like these are used to ensure valid descriptions when
                    people enter them in web forms or other applications.</p></div><div class="book" title="4.3.4.4 Vocabulary Control as Dimensionality Reduction"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1529" class="firstname"></a>4.3.4.4 Vocabulary Control as Dimensionality Reduction</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">In most cases, a controlled vocabulary is a subset of the natural or
                    uncontrolled vocabulary, but sometimes it is a new set of invented terms. This
                    might sound odd until we consider that the goal of a controlled vocabulary is to
                    reduce the number of descriptive terms assignable to a resource. Stated this way

                    transforming a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional one. Reducing the

                    the correlations between resource descriptions to transform a large set into a
                    much smaller set of uncorrelated ones. In a way this implements the principle of
                    Sufficiency and Necessity we mentioned in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-930" title="4.3.4.1 Principles of Good Description">4.3.4.1 Principles of Good Description</a>
                    because it eliminates description dimensions or properties that do not
                    contribute much to distinguishing the resources.</p><p class="calibre5">Here is an oversimplified example that illustrates the idea. Suppose we have a
                    collection of resources, and every resource described as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">big</span>”</span> is
                    also described as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">red,</span>”</span> and every <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">small</span>”</span> resource is
                    also <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">green.</span>”</span> This perfect correlation between color and size means
                    that either of these properties is sufficient to distinguish <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">big

                    clever algorithms to figure that out. But if we have thousands of properties and
                    the correlations are only partial, we need the sophisticated statistical
                    approaches to choose the optimal set of description properties and terms, and in

                You could write out the lyrics, but describing the music itself requires a different
                approach. A DJ, for example, might care greatly about the beats per minute in each

class="calibre5">We can consider a family to be a collection of people affiliated by some connections
            with each other such as common ancestors or a common residence. The Simpson family
            includes a man named Homer and a woman named Marge, the married parents of three sibling
            children, a boy named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie. This is a somewhat magical
            family, because it speaks the same language as the local television station. In the
            English-speaking Simpson family, the boy describes his parents as his father and mother
            and his two siblings as his sisters. In the Spanish speaking Simpson family the boy
            refers to his parents as <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="es" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="es" class="firstterm">su padre y su madre</em></span>

            Chinese Simpson family Lisa and Maggie would refer to each other according to their
            relative ages; Lisa, the elder sister as <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="cn" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="cn" class="firstterm">jiě

            significance of kinship relations like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is parent of</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is sibling
                of</span>”</span> are familiar ones, making kinship a good starting point for understanding

                systems.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2016" href="#calibre_link-1945" class="calibre1">249</a>]</sup>An organizing system can make use of existing relationships among resources,
            or it can create relationships by applying organizing principles to arrange the
            resources. Organizing systems for digital resources or digital description resources are
            the most likely to rely on explicit relationships to enable interactions with the
            resources.</p><p class="calibre5">In a classic book called <em class="firstterm">Data and Reality</em>, <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">William</span> <span class="calibre1">Kent</span></span> defines a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-1587"><em class="firstterm">relationship</em></a></strong></span> as
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">an association among several things, with that association having
                    a particular significance</span>.</span>”</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2017" href="#calibre_link-1946" class="calibre1">250</a>]</sup><span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">The things being associated,</span>”</span> the components of the
            relationship, are people in kinship relationships but more generally can be any type of
            resource (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>), when we relate one resource instance to another.
            When we describe a resource (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>), the components of the
            relationship are a primary resource and a description resource. If we specify sets of
            relationships that go together, we are using these common relationships to define
            resource types or classes, which more generally are called categories (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>). We can then use resource types as one or both the components
            of a relationship when we want to further describe the resource type or to assert how
            two resource types go together to facilitate our interactions with them.</p><p class="calibre5">We begin with a more complete definition of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">relationship</span>”</span> and introduce
            five perspectives for analyzing them: semantic, lexical, structural, architectural, and
            implementation.</p><p class="calibre5">We then discuss each perspective, introducing the issues that each emphasizes, and the
            specialized vocabulary needed to describe and analyze relationships from that point of
            view. We apply these perspectives and vocabulary to briefly analyze the most important
            types and applications of relationships in organizing systems.</p></div><div class="book" title="5.2 Describing Relationships: An Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-1537" class="firstname"></a>5.2 Describing Relationships: An Overview</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The concept of a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">relationship</span>”</span> is pervasive in human societies in both
            informal and formal senses. Humans are inescapably related to generations of ancestors,
            and in most cases they also have social networks of friends, co-workers, and casual
            acquaintances to whom they are related in various ways.</p><p class="calibre5">We often hear that our access to information, money, jobs, and political power is all
            about <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">who you know,</span>”</span> so we strive to <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">network</span>”</span> with other
            people to build relationships that might help us expand our access. In information
            systems, relationships between resources embody the organization that enables
                <span class="calibre1">finding</span>, <span class="calibre1">selection</span>, <span class="calibre1">retrieval</span>,
            and other interactions.</p><p class="calibre5">Most organizing systems are based on many relationships to enable the system to
            satisfy some intentional purposes with individual resources or the collection as a
            whole. In the domain of information resources, common resources include web pages,
            journal articles, books, data sets, metadata records, and <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>
            documents, among many others. Important relationships in the information domain that
            facilitate purposes like finding, identifying, and selecting resources include <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is
                the author of</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is published by</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">has publication
                date</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is derived from</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">has subject keyword</span>”</span>,
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is related to,</span>”</span> and many others.</p><p class="calibre5">When we talk about relationships we specify both the resources that are associated
            along with a name or statement about the reason for the association. Just identifying
            the resources involved is not enough because several different relationships can exist
            among the same resources; the same person can be your brother, your employer, and your
            landlord. Furthermore, for many relationships the directionality or ordering of the
            participants in a relationship statement matters; the person who is your employer gives
            a paycheck to you, not vice versa. Kent points out that when we describe a relationship
            we sometimes use whole phrases, such as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is-employed-by</span>”</span>, if our language
            does not contain a single word that expresses the meaning of the relationship.</p><p class="calibre5">We can analyze relationships from several different perspectives: </p><div class="book"><dl class="book"><dt class="calibre15">semantic perspective</dt><dd class="calibre16"><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-1752" class="calibre1"></a>The semantic perspective is the

                    perspective</em></a></strong></span> is the essence of relationships and explains
            why the resources are related, relying on information that is not directly available
            from perceiving the resources.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2018" href="#calibre_link-1947" class="calibre1">251</a>]</sup>In our Simpson family example, we noted that Homer and Marge are related by
            marriage, and also by their relationship as parents of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, and none
            of these relationships are directly perceivable.</p><p class="calibre5">A common way to specify a semantic relationship is as a predicate with one or more
            arguments. In many relationships the predicate is an action or association that involves
            multiple participants that must be of particular types, and the arguments define the
            different roles of the participants.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2019" href="#calibre_link-1948" class="calibre1">252</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">We can express the relationship between Homer and Marge Simpson using a
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">predicate(argument(s))</em></span> syntax as follows:</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre13"></br>

            relationship expression. The sequence and role are explicitly distinguished when
            predicates that take two arguments are expressed using a
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">subject-predicate-object</em></span> syntax that is often called a
                <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-748"><em class="firstterm">triple</em></a> because of its three

            means. People can demonstrate their understanding of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is-married-to</span>”</span> by
            realizing that alternative and semantically equivalent expressions of the relationship
            between Homer and Marge might be</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre13"></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">Homer&nbsp;Simpson&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;is-married-to&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;Marge&nbsp;Simpson</strong></span><br class="calibre13"></br>

            different expressions of the relationship because they have semantic and linguistic
            knowledge that relates some representation of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">married,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">husband,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">wife,</span>”</span> and other words. None of that knowledge is visible in the
            expressions of the relationships so far, all of which specify concrete relationships
            about individuals and not abstract relationships between resource classes or concepts.
            We have simply pushed the problem of what it means to understand the expressions into
            the mind of the person doing the understanding.</p><p class="calibre5">We can be more rigorous and define the words used in these expressions so they are
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">in the world</span>”</span> rather than just <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">in the mind</span>”</span> of the
            person understanding them. We can write definitions about these resource
                classes:<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2020" href="#calibre_link-1949" class="calibre1">253</a>]</sup>

                    narrowly, restricting it to expressions with predicates with only one argument

                    relationships between resources or resource types that require two

                    attributes and two-predicate relationships depends on context.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2027" href="#calibre_link-1956" class="calibre1">260</a>]</sup>For example, small can be viewed as an attribute, <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">X <span class="calibre1">→</span> is-small,</strong></span> or as a
                    relationship between X and some standard or reference Y, <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">X <span class="calibre1">→</span> is-smaller-than <span class="calibre1">→</span>
                        Y.</strong></span></p><p class="calibre5">Another somewhat tricky aspect of attribution relationships is that from a
                    semantic perspective, there are often many different ways of expressing
                    equivalent attribute values.</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">Martin&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;has-size&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;6&nbsp;inches</strong></span><br class="calibre13"></br>

However,
                    many implementations of attribution relationships treat the attribute values
                    literally. This means that unless we can process these two statements about
                    Martin using another relationship that expresses the conversion of inches to mm,
                    the two statements could be interpreted as saying different things about his
                    size.</p><p class="calibre5">Finally, we note that we can express attribution relationships about other
                    relationships, like the date a relationship was established. Homer and Marge
                    Simpson's wedding anniversary is an attribute of their
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is-married-to</span>”</span> relationship.</p><p class="calibre5">The semantic distinctions between attributes and other types of relationships
                    are not strong ones, but they can be made clearer by implementation choices. For
                    example, <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> attributes are tightly coupled to a containing
                    element, and their literal values are limited to atomic items of information. In
                    contrast, inclusion relationships are expressed by literal containment of one
                        <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> element by another. </p></div><div class="book" title="5.3.1.3 Possession"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2319" class="firstname"></a>5.3.1.3 Possession</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">A third distinct category of semantic relationships is that of possession.
                        <em class="firstterm">Possession</em> relationships can seem
                    superficially like part-whole ones:</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">Bob&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<span class="calibre1">→</span>&nbsp;a&nbsp;car</strong></span><br class="calibre13"></br>

                    elliptical form of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">has as a part,</span>”</span> expressing a component-object
                    relationship rather that one of possession.</p><p class="calibre5">The concept of possession is especially important in institutional organizing
                    systems, where questions of ownership, control, responsibility and transfers of
                    ownership, control, and responsibility can be fundamental parts of the
                    interactions they support. However, possession is a complex notion, inherently
                    connected to societal norms and conventions about property and kinship, making
                    it messier than institutional processes might like. Possession relationships
                    also imply duration or persistence, and are often difficult to distinguish from
                    relationships based on habitual location or practice. Miller and Johnson-Laird
                    illustrate the complex nature of possession relationships with this sentence,
                    which expresses three different types of them:<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2028" href="#calibre_link-1957" class="calibre1">261</a>]</sup></p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">He owns an umbrella but she's borrowed it,

                    example, because <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">is-parent-of</span>”</span> is an <em class="firstterm">asymmetric</em> relationship, only the first of these relationships

                not pretend to answer it to any extent here. However, we can sketch out some of the
                basic parts of the solution.</p><p class="calibre5">Let us begin by recalling that a <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-418"><em class="firstterm">taxonomy</em></a> captures a system of class inclusion
                relationships in some domain. But as we have seen, there are a great many kinds of
                relationships that are not about class inclusion. All of these other types of
                relationships represent knowledge about the domain that is potentially needed to
                understand statements about it and to make sense when more than one domain of
                resources or activities comes together.</p><p class="calibre5">For example, in the food domain whose partial taxonomy appears in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-1864" title="5.3.1 Types of Semantic Relationships">5.3.1 Types of Semantic Relationships</a>, we can assert relationships about properties of
                classes and instances, express equivalences about them, and otherwise enhance the
                representation of the food domain to create a complex network of relationships. In
                addition, the food domain intersects with food preparation, agriculture, commerce,
                and many other domains. We also need to express the relationships among these
                domains to fully understand any of them.</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><br class="calibre13"></br>

            intrinsically tied to the lexical one because a relationship is always expressed using
            words in a specific language. For example, we understand the relationships among the
            concepts or classes of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">food,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">meat,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">beef</span>”</span> by using the words <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">food,</span>”</span>

            they use to describe particular kinship relationships. Furthermore, we pointed out that
            cultures differ in which kinship relationships are conceptually distinct, so that
            languages like Chinese make distinctions about the relative ages of siblings that are
            not made in English.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2033" href="#calibre_link-1962" class="calibre1">266</a>]</sup> This is not to suggest that an English speaker cannot notice the difference

                <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> captured in a single word <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> as it is
            in Chinese. This <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">missing word</span>”</span> in English from the perspective of Chinese
            is called a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">lexical gap</span>”</span>.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2034" href="#calibre_link-1963" class="calibre1">267</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Earlier in this book we discussed the naming of resources (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-1236" title="3.4.2 The Problems of Naming">3.4.2 The Problems of Naming</a>) and the design of a vocabulary for resource description

            scale of an organizing system made it essential to be more systematic and precise in
            assigning names and descriptions. We need to be sure that the terms we use to organize
            resources capture the similarities and differences between them well enough to support
            our interactions with them. After our discussion about semantic relationships in this
            chapter, we now have a clearer sense of what is required to bring like things together,
            keep different things separate, and to satisfy any other goals for the organizing
            system.</p><p class="calibre5">For example, if we are organizing cars, buses, bicycles, and sleds, all of which are
            vehicles, there is an important distinction between vehicles that are motorized and
            those that are powered by human effort. It might also be useful to distinguish vehicles
            with wheels from those that lack them. Not making these distinctions leaves an

            the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">motorized</span>”</span> concept is lexicalized in English, which is why we needed

To do that, we
            need to be careful about how we talk about the relationships among words and how words
            relate to concepts. There are two different contexts for those relationships. First, we
            need to discuss relationships among the meanings of words. Second, we need to discuss

                    important. Whenever we create, combine, or compare resource descriptions we also

                    begin with the idea that all natural languages create words and word forms from
                    smaller units. These basic building blocks are called <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-1676"><em class="firstterm">morphemes</em></a> and can express semantic

                processing to create indexes for information retrieval; for example,

                    root form of words.</span> Similarly, simple text processing applications like
                hyphenation and spelling correction solve word form problems using roots and rules
                because it is more scalable and robust than solving them using word lists. Many
                misspellings of common words (e.g., <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pain</span>”</span>) are words of lower
                frequency (e.g., <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pane</span>”</span>), so adding <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pane</span>”</span> to a list of
                misspelled words would occasionally identify it incorrectly. In addition, because
                natural languages are generative and create new words all the time, a word list can
                never be complete; for example, when <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">flickr</span>”</span> occurs in text, is it a

                Likewise, many physical resources like paintings, sculptures, and manufactured goods
                have a material integrity that makes us usually consider them as indivisible. For an
                information resource, however, it is almost always the case that it has or might
                have had some internal structure or sub-division of its constituent data
                elements.</p><p class="calibre5">In fact, since all computer files are merely encodings of bits, bytes, characters
                and strings, we can say with some certainty that most digital resources exhibit some
                internal structure, even if that structure is only discernible by software agents.
                The internal formats of word processing files, for example, have changed many times
                since their invention in the mid-twentieth century, converging on
                    <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> in the early twenty-first century.</p><p class="calibre5">When an author writes a document, he or she gives it some internal organization
                with its title, section headings, typographic conventions, page numbers, and other
                mechanisms that identify its parts and their significance or relationship to each
                other.</p><p class="calibre5">In data-intensive or transactional domains, document instances tend to be
                homogeneous because they are produced by or for automated processes, and their
                information components will appear predictably in the same structural relationships
                with each other. These structures typically form a hierarchy expressed in an
                    <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> schema or word processing style template.
                    <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> documents describe their component parts using
                content-oriented elements like <code class="literal">&lt;ITEM&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;NAME&gt;</code>, and <code class="literal">&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</code>, that are themselves often aggregate structures or containers for
                more granular elements. The structures of resources maintained in databases are
                typically less hierarchical, but the structures are precisely captured in database
                schemas.</p><p class="calibre5">
                <a id="calibre_link-1938" class="calibre1"></a> The internal parts of <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> documents can be described,
                found and selected using the XPath language, which defines the structures and
                patterns used by <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> forms, queries, and transformations. The key
                idea used by XPath is that the structure of <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> documents is a tree
                of information items called nodes, whose locations are described in terms of the
                relationships between nodes. The relationships built into XPath, which it calls
                axes, include self, child, parent, following, and preceding, making it very easy to
                specify a structure-based query like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">find all sections in Chapter 1 through
                    Chapter 5 that have at least two levels of subsections.</span>”</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2049" href="#calibre_link-1982" class="calibre1">284</a>]</sup> In addition, tools like Schematron take advantage of XPath's structural
                descriptions to test assertions about a document's structure and content. For
                example, a common editorial constraint might be that a numbered list must have at
                least three items.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2050" href="#calibre_link-1983" class="calibre1">285</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">In more qualitative, less information-intensive and more experience-intensive
                domains, we move toward the narrative end of the document type spectrum, and
                document instances become more heterogeneous because they are produced by and for
                people (See the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-791" title="The Document Type Spectrum">The Document Type Spectrum</a></span>”</span> sidebar in
                    <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-609" title="3.2.1 Resource Domain">3.2.1 Resource Domain</a>). The information conveyed in the documents is
                conceptual or thematic rather than transactional, and the structural relationships
                between document parts are much weaker. Instead of precise structure and content
                rules,, there is usually just a shallow hierarchy marked up with Word processing or
                    <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr> tags like <code class="literal">&lt;HEAD&gt;</code>,
                    <code class="literal">&lt;H1&gt;</code>, <code class="literal">&lt;H2&gt;</code>,
                and <code class="literal">&lt;LIST&gt;</code>. .</p><p class="calibre5">The internal structural hierarchy in a resource is often extracted and made into a
                separate and familiar description resource called the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">table of
                    contents</span>”</span> to support finding and navigation interactions with the primary
                resource. In a printed media context, any given content resource is likely to only
                be presented once, and its page number is provided in the table of contents to allow
                the reader to locate the chapter, section or appendix in question. In a hypertext
                media context, a given resource may be a chapter in one book while being an appendix
                in another. Some tables of contents are created as a static structural description,
                but others are dynamically generated from the internal structures whenever the
                resource is accessed. In addition, other types of entry points can be generated from
                the names or descriptions of content components, like selectable lists of tables,
                figures, maps, or code examples.</p><p class="calibre5">Identifying the components and their structural relationships in documents is
                easier when they follow consistent rules for structure (e.g., every non-text
                component must have a title and caption) and presentation (e.g., <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-437"><em class="firstterm">hypertext links</em></a> in web pages are
                underlined and change cursor shapes when they are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">moused over</span>”</span>) that
                reinforce the distinctions between types of information components. Structural and
                presentation features are often ordered on some dimension (e.g., type size, line
                width, amount of white space) and used in a correlated manner to indicate the
                importance of a content component.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2051" href="#calibre_link-1984" class="calibre1">286</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Many indexing algorithms treat documents as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">bags of words</span>”</span> to

                links among a set of pages remain mostly within those pages, as they are in an
                e-commerce catalog site. More often, however, links connect to pages in other sites,

                    or character, a paragraph, a document, or any part of the resource to which the
                    ends of link are connected. The anchor and destination of a web link are its
                    structural specification, but we often need to consider links from other

                compliant but does not mean that an expression is semantically comprehensible; the
                classic example is Chomsky's anomalous sentence:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">Colorless green ideas sleep

                the expressions that it needs to express. For the examples in this chapter we used
                an informal combination of English words and symbols (arrows and parentheses) that
                you could understand easily, but simple language is incapable of expressing most of
                what we readily say in English. But this benefit of natural language only accrues to
                people, and the more restrictive and formal syntax is easier to understand for
                computers.</p><p class="calibre5">A second consideration is that the implementation can be understood and used by
                its intended users. We can usually express a relationship in different languages
                while preserving its meaning, just as we can usually implement the same computing
                functionality in different programming languages. From a semantic perspective these
                three expressions are equivalent:</p><div class="book"><div class="book"><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">My&nbsp;name&nbsp;is&nbsp;Homer&nbsp;Simpson</strong></span><br class="calibre13"></br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="de" class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">Mein&nbsp;name&nbsp;ist&nbsp;Homer&nbsp;Simpson</strong></span></p></div></div><p class="calibre5">However, whether these expressions are equivalent for someone reading them depends
                on which languages they understand.</p><p class="calibre5">An analogous situation occurs with the implementation of web pages.
                    <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr> was invented as a language for encoding how web pages look
                in a browser, and most of the tags in <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr> represent the simple
                structure of an analogous print document. Representing paragraphs, list items and
                numbered headings with <code class="literal">&lt;P&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;LI&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;H<em class="replaceable"><code class="replaceable">n</code></em>&gt;</code> makes using <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr>
                so easy that school children can create web pages. However, the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">web for

                analyzed and processed. This <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">web for computers</span>”</span> is best implemented

                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Pyramid</em></span>”</span> aired in North America. The show
            featured two competing teams, each team consisting of two contestants: an ordinary
            civilian contestant and a celebrity. In the show's first round, both teams' members
            viewed a pyramid-shaped sign that displayed six category titles, some straightforward
            like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Where You Live</span>”</span> and others less conventional like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Things You
                Need to Feed.</span>”</span> Each team then had an opportunity to compete for points in
            30-second turns. The goal was for one team member to gain points by identifying a word
            or phrase related to the category from clues provided by the other team member. For
            example, a target phrase for the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Where You Live</span>”</span> category might be
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">zip code,</span>”</span> and the clue might be <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Mine is 94705.</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Things you Need to Feed</span>”</span> might include both <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">screaming baby</span>”</span>
            and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">parking meter.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">The team that won the first round advanced to the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Winner's Circle,</span>”</span>
            where the game was turned around. This time, only the clue giver was shown the category
            name and had to suggest concepts or instances belonging to that category so that the
            teammate could guess the category name. Clues like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">alto,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">soprano,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">tenor</span>”</span> would be given to prompt the teammate
            to guess <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Singing Voices</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Types of Singers.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">As the game progressed, the categories became more challenging. It was interesting and
            entertaining to hear the clue receiver's initial guess and how subsequent guesses
            changed with more clues. The person giving clues would often become frustrated, because
            to them their clues seemed obvious and discriminating but would seem not to help the
            clue receivers in identifying the category. Viewers enjoyed sharing in these moments of
            vocabulary and category confusion.</p><p class="calibre5">The Pyramid TV game show developers created a textbook example for teaching about
            categories -- groups or classes of things, people, processes, events or anything else
            that we treat as equivalent -- and categorization -- the process of assigning instances
            to categories. The game is a useful analog for us to illustrate many of the issues we
            discuss in this chapter. The Pyramid game was challenging, and sometimes comical,
            because people bring their own experiences and biases to understanding what a category
            means, and because not every instance of a category is equally typical or suggestive.
            How we organize reflects our thinking processes, which can inadvertently reveal personal
            characteristics that can be amusing in a social context. Hence, the popularity of the
                <span class="calibre1">Pyramid</span> franchise, which began on <abbr class="calibre1">CBS</abbr> in
            1973 and has been produced in 20 countries.</p><p class="calibre5">Many texts in library science introduce categorization via cataloguing rules, a set of
            highly prescriptive methods for assigning resources to categories that some describe and
            others satirize as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">mark 'em and park 'em.</span>”</span> Similarly, many texts in
            computer science discuss the process of defining the categories needed to create,
            process, and store information in terms of programming language constructs:
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">here's how to define an abstract type, and here's the data type
                system.</span>”</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-618" href="#calibre_link-543" class="calibre1">316</a>]</sup> We take a very different approach in this chapter. In the following
            sections, we discuss how and why we create categories, reviewing some important work in
            philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive psychology so that we can better understand how
            categories are created and used in organizing systems. We discuss how the way we
            organize differs when we act as individuals or as members of social, cultural, or
            institutional groups; later we share principles for creating categories, design choices
            and implementation experience. As usual, we close the chapter with a summary of the key
            points.</p></div><div class="book" title="6.2 What Categories Are and Why We Create Them"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-523" class="firstname"></a>6.2 What Categories Are and Why We Create Them</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-324" class="calibre1"></a>Categories are <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-325"><em class="firstterm">equivalence
                classes</em></a></strong></span>, sets or groups of things or abstract entities that
                we treat the same.</span> This does not mean that every instance of a category is
            identical, only that from some perspective, or for some purpose, we are treating them as
            equivalent based on what they have in common. When we consider something as a member of
            a category, we are making choices about which of its properties or roles we are focusing
            on and which ones we are ignoring. We do this automatically and unconsciously most of
            the time, but we can also do it in an explicit and self-aware way.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-619" href="#calibre_link-544" class="calibre1">317</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">When we encounter objects or situations, recognizing them as members of a category
            helps us know how to interact with them. For example, when we enter an unfamiliar
            building we might need to open or pass through an entryway that we recognize as a door.
            We might never have seen that particular door before, but it has properties and
            affordances that we know that all doors have; it has a doorknob or a handle; it allows
            access to a larger space; it opens and closes. By mentally assigning this particular
            door to the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">doors</span>”</span> category we distinguish it from <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">windows,</span>”</span>
            a category that also contains objects that sometimes have handles and that open and
            close, but which we do not normally pass through to enter another space. Categorization
            judgments are therefore not just about what is included in a class, but also about what
            is excluded from a class. Nevertheless, the category boundaries are not sharp; a
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Dutch door</span>”</span> is divided horizontally in half so that the bottom can be
            closed like a door while the top can stay open like a window.</p><p class="calibre5">Categories are <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">cognitive and linguistic models</strong></span> for
            applying prior knowledge; creating and using categories are essential human activities.
            Categories enable us to relate things to each other in terms of similarity and
            dissimilarity and are involved whenever we perceive, communicate, analyze, predict, or
            classify. Without categories, we would perceive the world as an unorganized blur of
            things with no understandable or memorable relation to each other. Every wall-entry we
            encounter would be new to us, and we would have to discover its properties and supported
            interactions as though we had never before encountered a door. Of course, we still often
            need to identify something as a particular instance, but categories enable us to
            understand how it is equivalent to other instances. We can interchangeably relate to
            something as specific as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the wooden door to the main conference room</span>”</span> or
            more generally as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">any door.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">All human languages and cultures divide up the world into categories. How and why this
            takes place has long been debated by philosophers, psychologists and anthropologists.
            One explanation for this differentiation is that people recognize structure in the
            world, and then create categories of things that <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">go together</span>”</span> or are
            somehow similar. An alternative view says that human minds make sense of the world by

                intuitively appealing because we can easily come up with examples of perceptible

                    understand cultural categorization. The more moderate position was crisply
                    characterized by Roman Jakobson, who said that <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">languages differ

                    created by intentional activity, in response to a specific situation, or to
                    solve an emerging organizational challenge. As a consequence, the categories in

                ways. First, individual categories sometimes have an imaginative or metaphorical
                basis that is meaningful to the person who created them but which might distort or
                misinterpret cultural categories. Second, individual categories are often
                specialized or synthesized versions of cultural categories that capture particular
                experiences or personal history. For example, a person who has lived in China and
                Mexico, or lived with people from those places, might have highly individualized
                categories for foods they like and dislike that incorporate characteristics of both
                Chinese and Mexican cuisine.</p><p class="calibre5">Individual categories in organizing systems also reflect the idiosyncratic set of
                household goods, music, books, website bookmarks, or other resources that a person
                might have collected over time. The organizing systems for financial records,
                personal papers, or email messages often use highly specialized categories that are
                shaped by specific tasks to be performed, relationships with other people, events of
                personal history, and other highly individualized considerations.</p><p class="calibre5">Traditionally, <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2352" href="#calibre_link-557"><em class="firstterm">individual

                sites like the popular <span class="calibre1">Flickr</span> site for photos, people
                typically use existing cultural categories to tag their photos as well as individual
                ones that they invent. In particular, the typical syntactic constraint that tags are
                delimited by white space encourages the creation of new categories by combining
                existing category names using concatenation and camel case conventions; photos that
                could be categorized as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Berkeley</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Student</span>”</span> are thus

                    are created and used explicitly and rationally, and most often by many people or

                    costs.</span> Furthermore, instead of describing the world as it is,
                institutional categories are usually defined to change or control the world by
                imposing semantic models that are more formal and arbitrary than those in cultural
                categories. Laws, regulations, and standards often specify institutional categories,
                along with decision rules for assigning resources to new categories, and behavior
                rules that prescribe how people must interact with them.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-631" href="#calibre_link-559" class="calibre1">329</a>]</sup> The rigorous definition of institutional categories enables <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">classification:</strong></span> the systematic assignment of resources

                because it invariably requires significant efforts to reconcile mismatches between
                existing individual categories, where those categories embody useful working or
                contextual knowledge that is lost in the move to a formal institutional

                inconsistency of cultural categories because the former must often conform to
                stricter logical standards to support inference and meet legal requirements.
                Furthermore, institutional categorization is usually a process that must be
                accounted for in a budget and staffing plans. While some kinds of institutional
                categories can be devised or discovered by computational processes, most of them are
                created through the collaboration of many individuals, typically from various parts
                of an organization or from different firms.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-633" href="#calibre_link-561" class="calibre1">331</a>]</sup> The different business or technical perspectives of the participants are
                often the essential ingredients in developing robust categories that can meet
                carefully identified requirements. And as requirements change over time,
                institutional categories must often change as well, implying version control,
                compliance testing, and other formal <em class="firstterm">maintenance</em> and

                have found their way into more popular use and are now considered cultural
                categories. A good example is the periodic table in chemistry, which Mendeleev
                developed in 1869 as a new system of categories for the chemical elements. The
                periodic table proved essential to scientists in understanding their properties and
                in predicting undiscovered ones. Today the periodic table is taught in elementary
                schools, and many things other than elements are commonly organized using a
                graphical structure that resembles the periodic table of elements in chemistry,
                including sci-fi films and movies, desserts, and superheroes.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-634" href="#calibre_link-562" class="calibre1">332</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.2.4 A Categorization Continuum"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-526" class="firstname"></a>6.2.4 A <span class="firstname">“<span class="firstname">Categorization Continuum</span>”</span></h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">As we have seen, the concepts of cultural, individual, and institutional
                categorization usefully distinguish the primary processes and purposes for creating
                categories. However, these three kinds of categories can fuse, clash, and recombine
                with each other. Rather than viewing them as having precise boundaries, we might
                view them as regions on a continuum of categorization activities and methods.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider a few different perspectives on categorizing animals as an example.
                Scientific institutions categorize animals according to explicit, principled
                classification systems, such as a Linnaean taxonomy that assigns animals to a
                phylum, class, order, family, genus and species. Cultural categorization practices
                cannot be adequately described in terms of a master taxonomy, and are more fluid,
                converging with principled taxonomies sometimes, and diverging at other times. While
                human beings are classified within the animal kingdom in biological classification
                systems, people are usually not considered animals in most cultural contexts.
                Sometimes a scientific designation for human beings, <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="firstterm">homo sapiens</em></span> is even applied to human beings in cultural
                contexts, since the genus-species taxonomic designation has influenced cultural
                conceptions of people and (other) animals over the years.</p><p class="calibre5">Animals are also often culturally categorized as pets or non-pets. The category
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pets,</span>”</span> in the US mainstream, commonly includes dogs, cats, and
                fish. A pet cat might be categorized at multiple levels that incorporate individual,
                cultural, and institutional perspectives on categorization <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span>
                as an <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">animal</span>”</span> (cultural/institutional), as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">mammal</span>”</span>

                being identified individually by one or more pet names. Furthermore, not everyone
                experiences pets as just dogs, cats and fish. Some people have relatively unusual
                pets, like pigs. For individuals who have pet pigs or who know people with pet pigs,
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pigs</span>”</span> may be included in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pets</span>”</span> category. If
                enough people have pet pigs, eventually <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pigs</span>”</span> could be included in
                mainstream culture's pet category.</p><p class="calibre5">It is not possible to entirely separate individual, cultural and institutional
                perspectives on categorization. Individuals form subcultures and contribute to
                institutions; culture influences individuals and institutions; institutions
                influence individuals and culture.</p><p class="calibre5">Categorization skewed toward cultural perspectives incorporate relatively
                traditional categories, such as those learned implicitly from social interactions,
                like mainstream understandings of what kinds of animals are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pets</span>”</span>,
                while categorization skewed toward institutional perspectives emphasizes explicit,
                formal categories, like the categories employed in biological classification
                systems.</p><p class="calibre5">A final example that demonstrates the interplay and conflict between the different
                contexts of categorization involves the vehicle categories in the US <em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-2355" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</span>(CAFE)</span></em> standards. The <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> standards sort vehicles into <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">passenger car</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">light truck</span>”</span> categories and impose higher minimum fuel efficiency
                requirements for cars because trucks have different typical uses.</p><p class="calibre5">When <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> standards were first introduced in
                1975, the vehicles classified as light trucks were generally used for <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">light
                    duty</span>”</span> farming and manufacturing purposes. <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Light trucks</span>”</span>
                might be thought of as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">sort of</span>”</span> in-between category
                    <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> a light truck is not really a car, but sufficiently
                unlike a prototypical truck to qualify the vehicle's categorization as
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">light.</span>”</span> Formalizing this sense of in-between-ness by specifying
                features that define a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">car</span>”</span> and a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">light truck</span>”</span> is the
                only way to implement a consistent, transparent fuel efficiency policy that makes
                use of informal, graded distinctions between vehicles.</p><p class="calibre5">A manufacturer whose average fuel economy for all the vehicles it sells in a year
                falls below the <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> standards has to pay
                penalties. This encourages them to produce <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">sport utility

                    <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> definitions of light trucks but which most people use as
                passenger cars. Similarly, the <span class="calibre1">PT Cruiser</span>, a retro-styled
                hatchback produced by <span class="calibre1">Chrysler</span> from 2000-2010, strikes many
                people as a car. It looks like a car; we associate it with the transport of
                passengers rather than with farming; and in fact it is formally classified as a car
                under emissions standards. But like <abbr class="calibre1">SUV</abbr>s, in the
                    <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> classification system, the <span class="calibre1">PT

                institutional categories, which plays out in competing pressures from industry,
                government, and political organizations. Furthermore, <abbr class="calibre1">CAFE</abbr> standards and manufacturers' response to them are influencing
                cultural categories, such that our cultural understanding of what a car looks like
                is changing over time as manufacturers design vehicles like the <span class="calibre1">PT

                are defined by enumeration as a set of possible or legal values, like the 50 states
                in the <abbr class="calibre1">US</abbr> or the <abbr class="calibre1">ISO</abbr> currency codes (<span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">ISO 4217</span></span>).</p><p class="calibre5">Enumerative categories enable membership to be unambiguously determined because a
                value like state name or currency code is either a member of the category or it
                isn't. But there comes a size when enumerative definition is impractical or
                inefficient, and the category either must be sub-divided or be given a definition
                based on principles other than enumeration.</p><p class="calibre5">For example, for millennia we earthlings have had a cultural category of
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">planet</span>”</span> as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">wandering</span>”</span> celestial object, and
                because we only knew of planets in our own solar system, the planet category was
                defined by enumeration: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. When the
                outer planets of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were identified as planets in the
                    18<sup class="calibre11">th</sup>-20<sup class="calibre11">th</sup> centuries, they
                were added to this list of planets without any changes in the cultural category. But
                in the last couple of decades many heretofore unknown planets outside our solar
                system have been detected, making the set of planets unbounded, and definition by
                enumeration no longer works.</p><p class="calibre5">The <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">International Astronomical
                        Union</span></span>(IAU)</span> thought it solved this category crisis in 2006 by proposing a
                definition of planet as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">a celestial body that is (a) in orbit around a star,
                    (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so

                not satisfy the third requirement, so it no longer is a member of the planet

Therefore, it

                create categories, and the easiest ones to use are often the intrinsic static
                properties. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, intrinsic static
                properties are those inherent in a resource that never change. The size, color,
                shape, weight, material of composition, and texture of natural or manufactured
                objects are intrinsic and static properties that can be used to arrange physical
                resources. For example, an organizing system for a personal collection of music that
                is based on the intrinsic static property of physical format might use categories
                for CDs, DVDs, vinyl albums, 8-track cartridges, reel-to-reel tape and tape
                    cassettes.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-638" href="#calibre_link-569" class="calibre1">336</a>]</sup> Using a single property is most natural to do when the properties can
                take on only a small set of discrete values like music formats, and especially when
                the property is closely related to how the resources are used, as they are with the
                music collection where each format requires different equipment to listen to the
                music. Each value then becomes a subcategory of the music category.</p><p class="calibre5">The author, date, and location of creation of an intellectual resource cannot be
                directly perceived but they are also intrinsic static properties. The subject matter
                or purpose of a resource, its <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what it is about</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">what it was
                    originally for,</span>”</span> are also intrinsic static properties that are not
                directly perceivable, especially for information resources.</p><p class="calibre5">The name or identifier of a resource is often arbitrary but once assigned normally
                does not change, making it an extrinsic static property. Any collection of resources
                with alphabetic or numeric identifiers as an associated property can use sorting
                order as an organizing principle to arrange spices, books, personnel records, etc.,
                in a completely reliable way. Some might argue whether this organizing principle
                creates a category system, or whether it simply exploits the ordering inherent in
                the identifier notation. For example, with alphabetic identifiers, we can think of
                alphabetic ordering as creating a recursive category system with 26 (A-Z) top-level
                categories, each containing the same number of second-level categories, and so on
                until every instance is assigned to its proper place.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-639" href="#calibre_link-570" class="calibre1">337</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Some resource properties are both extrinsic and dynamic because they are based on
                usage or behaviors that can be highly context-dependent. The current owner or
                location of a resource, its frequency of access, the joint frequency of access with
                other resources, or its current rating or preference with respect to alternative
                resources are typical extrinsic and dynamic properties that can be the basis for
                arranging resources and defining categories.</p><p class="calibre5">These properties can have a large number of values or are continuous measures, but
                as long as there are explicit rules for using property values to determine category
                assignment the resulting categories are still easy to understand and use. For
                example, we naturally categorize people we know on the basis of their current
                profession, the city where they live, their hobbies, or their age. Properties with a
                numerical dimension like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">frequency of use</span>”</span> are often transformed into
                a small set of categories like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">frequently used,</span>”</span>
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">occasionally used,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">rarely used</span>”</span> based on the
                numerical property values.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-640" href="#calibre_link-571" class="calibre1">338</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">While there are an infinite number of logically expressible properties for any
                resource, most of them would not lead to informative and useful categories.
                Therefore, it is important to choose properties that are psychologically or
                pragmatically relevant for the resource domain being categorized. Whether something
                weighs more or less than 5000 pounds is a poor property to apply to things in
                general, because it puts cats and chairs in one category, and buses and elephants in
                    another.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-641" href="#calibre_link-572" class="calibre1">339</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">To summarize: The most useful single properties to use for creating categories for
                an organizing system are those that are formally assigned, objectively measurable
                and orderable, or tied to well-established cultural categories, because the
                resulting categories will be easier to understand and describe.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1572" class="calibre1"></a><a id="calibre_link-1942" class="calibre1"></a>If only a single property is used to distinguish among some set of
                resources and to create the categories in an organizing system, the choice of
                property is critical because different properties often lead to different
                categories. Using the age property, <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Bill</span> <span class="calibre1">Gates</span></span> and <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Mark</span> <span class="calibre1">Zuckerberg</span></span> are unlikely to end up in the same category of people. Using the
                wealth property, they most certainly would. Furthermore, if only one property is
                used to create a system of categories, any category with a large numbers of items in
                it will lack coherence because differences on other properties will be too apparent,
                and some category members will not fit as well as the others.</p></div><div class="book" title="6.3.3 Multiple Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-530" class="firstname"></a>6.3.3 Multiple Properties</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Organizing systems often use multiple properties to define categories.

                    pants using a single property (the part of body on which the clothes are worn)
                    you might arrange the shirts by style, and then by sleeve length, and finally by
                    color. When all of the resources in an organizing system are arranged using the
                    same sequence of resource properties, this creates a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-573"><em class="firstterm">logical
                            hierarchy</em></a></strong></span>, a multi-level category system.</p><p class="calibre5">If we treat all the shirts as the collection being organized, in the shirt
                    organizing system the broad category of shirts is first divided by style into
                    categories like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">dress shirts,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">work shirts,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">party shirts,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">athletic or sweatshirts.</span>”</span> Each of
                    these style categories is further divided until the categories are very narrow
                    ones, like the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white long-sleeve dress shirts</span>”</span> category. A
                    particular shirt ends up in this last category only after passing a series of
                    property tests along the way: it is a dress shirt, it has long sleeves, and it
                    is white. Each test creates more precise categories in the intersections of the
                    categories whose members passed the prior property tests.</p><p class="calibre5">Put another way, each subdivision of a category takes place when we identify
                    or choose a property that differentiates the members of the category in a way
                    that is important or useful for some intent or purpose. Shirts differ from pants
                    in the value of the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">part of body</span>”</span> property, and all the shirt
                    subcategories share this <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">top part</span>”</span> value of that property.
                    However, shirts differ on other properties that determine the subcategory to
                    which they belong. Even as we pay attention to these differentiating properties,
                    it is important to remember the other properties, the ones that members of a
                    category at any level in the hierarchy have in common with the members of the
                    categories that contain it. These properties are often described as <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">inherited</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">inferred</span>”</span> from the broader
                        category.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-642" href="#calibre_link-574" class="calibre1">340</a>]</sup> For example, just as every shirt shares the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">worn on top part
                        of body</span>”</span> property, every item of clothing shares the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">can be
                        worn on the body</span>”</span> property, and every resource in the
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">pants</span>”</span> category inherits that
                    property.</p><p class="calibre5">Each differentiating property creates another level in the category hierarchy,
                    which raises an obvious question: How many properties and levels do we need? In
                    order to answer this question we must reflect upon the shirt categories in our
                    closet. Our <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                        system</em></a> for shirts arranges them with the three properties of
                    style, sleeve length, and color; some of the categories at the lowest level of
                    the resulting hierarchy might have only one member, or no members at all. You
                    might have yellow or red short-sleeved party shirts, but probably don't have
                    yellow or red long-sleeved dress shirts, making them empty categories Obviously,
                    any category with only one member does not need any additional properties to
                    tell the members apart, so a category hierarchy is logically complete if every
                    resource is in a category by itself.</p><p class="calibre5">However, even when the lowest level categories of our shirt organizing system
                    have more than one member, we might choose not to use additional properties to
                    subdivide it because the differences that remain among the members do not matter
                    to us for the interactions the organizing system needs to support. Suppose we
                    have two long-sleeve white dress shirts from different shirt makers, but
                    whenever we need to wear one of them, we ignore this property. Instead, we just
                    pick one or the other, treating the shirts as completely equivalent or
                    substitutable. When the remaining differences between members of a category do
                    not make a difference to the users of the category, we can say that the
                    organizing system is pragmatically, or practically complete even if it is not
                    yet logically complete. That is to say, it is complete <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">for all intents
                        and purposes.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">On the other hand, consider the shirt section of a big department store.
                    Shirts there might be organized by style, sleeve length, and color as they are
                    in our home closet, but would certainly be further organized by shirt maker and
                    by size to enable a shopper to find a <span class="calibre1">Marc Jacobs</span> long-sleeve
                    blue dress shirt of size 15/35. The department store organizing system needs
                    more properties and a deeper hierarchy for the shirt domain because it has a
                    much larger number of shirt instances to organize and because it needs to
                    support many shirt shoppers, not just one person whose shirts are all the same
                    size.</p></div><div class="book" title="6.3.3.2 Different Properties for Subsets of Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2356" class="firstname"></a>6.3.3.2 Different Properties for Subsets of Resources</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">A different way to use multiple resource properties to create categories in an
                    organizing system is to employ different properties for distinct subsets of the
                    resources being organized. This contrasts with the strict multi-level approach
                    in which every resource is evaluated with respect to every property.
                    Alternatively, we could view this principle as a way of organizing multiple
                    domains that are conceptually or physically adjacent, each of which has a
                    separate set of categories based on properties of the resources in that domain.
                    This principle is used for most folder structures in computer file systems and
                    by many email applications; you can create as many folder categories as you
                    want, but any resource can only be placed in one folder.</p><p class="calibre5">The contrasts between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, and between static
                    and dynamic ones, are helpful in explaining this method of creating organizing
                    categories. For example, you might organize all of your clothes using intrinsic
                    static properties if you keep your shirts, socks, and sweaters in different
                    drawers and arrange them by color; extrinsic static properties if you share your
                    front hall closet with a roommate, so you each use only one side of that closet
                    space; intrinsic dynamic properties if you arrange your clothes for ready access
                    according to the season; and, extrinsic dynamic properties if you keep your most
                    frequently used jacket and hat on a hook by the front door.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-643" href="#calibre_link-575" class="calibre1">341</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">If we relax the requirement that different subsets of resources use different
                    organizing properties and allow any property to be used to describe any
                    resource, the loose organizing principle we now have is often called <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-576"><em class="firstterm">tagging</em></a></strong></span>. Using any property of a resource to
                    create a description is an uncontrolled and often unprincipled principle for
                    creating categories, but it is increasingly popular for organizing photos, web
                    sites, email messages in gmail, or other web-based resources. We discuss tagging

                    with just a few <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">essential</strong></span> properties. For
                    example, a prime number is a positive integer that has no divisors other than 1
                    and itself, and this category definition perfectly distinguishes prime and
                    not-prime numbers no matter how many numbers are being categorized.
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Positive integer</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">divisible only by 1 and

                    every prime number must satisfy these properties. These properties are also

                    membership in the prime number category; any number that satisfies the necessary

                        many ways we still adhere to classical views of categories when we create
                        organizing systems because they can be easier to implement and maintain that
                        way.</span></p><div class="sidebar"><a id="calibre_link-580" class="calibre1"></a><p class="title4">The Classical View of Categories</p><p class="calibre5">The classical view is that categories are defined by necessary and
                        sufficient properties. This theory has been enormously influential in
                        Western thought, and is embodied in many organizing systems, especially
                        those for information resources. This principle of defining categories is
                        conceptually simple and has a straightforward implementation in technologies
                        like database schemas, decision trees, and classes in programming
                        languages.</p><p class="calibre5">However, as we will explain, we cannot rely on this principle to create
                        categories in many domains and contexts because there are not necessary and
                        sufficient properties. As a result, many psychologists, cognitive
                        scientists, and computer scientists who think about categorization have
                        criticized the classical theory.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1430" class="calibre1"></a><a id="calibre_link-1879" class="calibre1"></a>We think this is unfair to <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Aristotle</span></span>, who proposed what we now call the classical theory primarily
                        to explain how categories underlie the logic of deductive reasoning: All men
                        are mortal; <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Socrates</span></span>is a man; Therefore, <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Socrates</span></span> is mortal. People are wrong to turn Aristotle's thinking
                        around and apply it to the problem of <span class="calibre1">inductive reasoning</span>,
                        how categories are created in the first place. But this isn't <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Aristotle</span></span>'s fault; he was not trying to explain how natural cultural
                        categories arise.</p></div><p class="calibre5">An important implication of <span class="calibre1">necessary and sufficient category
                        definition</span> is that every member of the category is an equally good
                    member or example of the category; every prime number is equally prime.
                    Institutional category systems are often designed to have necessary and
                    sufficient properties because it makes them conceptually simple and gives them a
                    straightforward implementation in technologies like database schemas, decision
                    trees, and classes in programming languages.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider the definition of an address as requiring a street, city,
                    governmental region, and postal code. Anything that has all of these information
                    components is therefore considered to be a valid address, and anything that
                    lacks any of them will not be considered to be a valid address. If we refine the
                    properties of an address to require the governmental region to be a state, and
                    specifically one of the <span class="calibre1">United States Postal Service</span>'s list
                    of official state and territory codes, we create a subcategory for US addresses
                    that uses an enumerated category as part of its definition. Similarly, we could
                    create a subcategory for Canadian addresses by exchanging the name
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">province</span>”</span> for state, and using an enumerated list of Canadian

                basing categories on easily perceived properties is often not effective. There might

                between types of information resources, but these are often just presentation or
                packaging choices, That is to say, neither the size of a book nor the color of its
                cover are reliable cues for what it contains. Information resources have numerous
                descriptive properties like their title, author, and publisher that can be used more
                effectively to define categories, and these are certainly useful for some kinds of
                interactions, like finding all of the books written by a particular author or
                published by the same publisher. However, for practical purposes, the most useful
                property of an information resource is its <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-581"><em class="firstterm">aboutness</em></a></strong></span>, which may not be objectively perceivable and
                which is certainly hard to characterize.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-645" href="#calibre_link-582" class="calibre1">343</a>]</sup> Any collection of information resources in a library or document filing
                system is likely to be about many subjects and topics, and when an individual
                resource is categorized according to a limited number of its content properties, it
                is at the same time not being categorized using the others.</p><p class="calibre5">When the web first started, there were many attempts to create categories of web
                sites, most notably by <span class="calibre1">Yahoo!</span> As the web grew, it became obvious
                that search engines would be vastly more useful because their near real-time text
                indexes obviate the need for <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="firstterm">a priori</em></span>
                assignment of web pages to categories. Rather, web search engines represent each web
                page or document in a way that treats each word or term they contain as a separate
                property.</p><p class="calibre5">Considering every distinct word in a document as a property stretches our notion
                of property to make it very different from the kinds of properties we have discussed
                in the previous two sections of this chapter. We do not need that generality yet, so

                properties is much less effective, and sometimes not even possible for domains where
                properties lack one or more of the characteristics of separability, perceptibility,
                and necessity. Instead, we need to categorize using properties in a statistical
                rather than a logical way to come up with some measure of resemblance or similarity
                between the resource to be categorized and the other members of the category.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider a familiar category like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">bird.</span>”</span> All birds have feathers,
                wings, beaks, and two legs. But there are thousands of types of birds, and they are
                distinguished by properties that some birds have that other birds lack: most birds
                can fly, most are active in the daytime, some swim, some swim underwater; some have
                webbed feet. These properties are correlated, a consequence of natural selection
                that conveys advantages to particular configurations of characteristics; birds that
                live in trees have different wings and feet than those that swim, for example. In
                the end, there is no single set of properties that are both necessary and sufficient
                to categorize a bird.</p><p class="calibre5">There are three related consequences of this complex distribution of properties
                for birds and for many other categories in cultural or natural (as opposed to
                man-made) domains. The first is an effect of <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-583"><em class="firstterm">typicality</em></a></strong></span> or <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-584"><em class="firstterm">centrality</em></a></strong></span> that makes some members of the category
                better examples than others, even if they share most properties. Most people
                consider a robin to be a more typical bird than a penguin.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-646" href="#calibre_link-585" class="calibre1">344</a>]</sup> Or try to define <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">friend</span>”</span> and ask yourself if all of the
                people you consider friends are equally good examples of the category. This effect
                is also described as <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9">gradience</strong></span> in category
                membership and reflects the extent to which the most characteristic properties are
                shared.</p><p class="calibre5">A second consequence is that the sharing of some but not all properties creates
                what we call <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-586"><em class="firstterm">family resemblances</em></a></strong></span> among the category members; just
                as biological family members do not necessarily all share a single set of physical
                features but still are recognizable as members of the same family. This idea was
                first proposed by the 20th century philosopher <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Ludwig</span> <span class="calibre1">Wittgenstein</span></span>, who used <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">games</span>”</span> as an example of a category whose
                members resemble each other according to shifting property subsets. See the Sidebar

                    mathematics, the mind, and language. In 1999 his <em class="firstterm">Philosophical
                        Investigations</em> was ranked as the most important book of
                        20<sup class="calibre10">th</sup> century philosophy in a poll of
                        philosophers.<sup class="calibre10">[<a id="calibre_link-648" href="#calibre_link-589" class="calibre1">346</a>]</sup> In that book, Wittgenstein uses <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">game</span>”</span> to argue that
                    many concepts have no defining properties, and that instead there is a
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing:
                        sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.</span>”</span> He
                    contrasts board games, card games, ball games, games of skill, games of luck,
                    games with competition, solitary games, and games for amusement. Wittgenstein
                    notes that not all games are equally good examples of the category, and jokes
                    about teaching children a gambling game with dice because he knows that this is
                    not the kind of game that the parents were thinking of when they asked him to
                    teach their children a game.</p></div><p class="calibre5">The third consequence, when categories do not have necessary features for
                membership, is that the boundaries of the category are not fixed; the category can
                be stretched and new members assigned as long as they resemble incumbent members.
                Personal video games and multiplayer online games like <span class="calibre1">World of
                    Warcraft</span> did not exist in Wittgenstein's time but we have no
                trouble recognizing them as games and neither would Wittgenstein, were he alive.
                Recall that in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-46" title="Chapter 1. Foundations for Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;1</a> we pointed out that the cultural category
                of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">library</span>”</span> has been repeatedly extended by new properties, as when
                    <span class="calibre1">Flickr</span> is described as a web-based photo-sharing
                library. Categories defined by family resemblance or multiple and shifting property
                sets are termed <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-590"><em class="firstterm">polythetic</em></a></strong></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">We conclude that instead of using properties one at a time to assign category
                membership, we can use them in a composite or integrated way to determine <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-591"><em class="firstterm">similarity</em></a></strong></span>. Something is categorized as an A and not
                a B if it is more similar to A's best or most typical member rather than it is to
                    B's.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-649" href="#calibre_link-592" class="calibre1">347</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.3.6 Similarity"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-533" class="firstname"></a>6.3.6 Similarity</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">Similarity</em></strong></span>
                is a very flexible notion whose meaning depends on the domain within which we apply
                    it.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-650" href="#calibre_link-593" class="calibre1">348</a>]</sup>To make similarity a useful mechanism for categorization we have to
                specify how the similarity measure is determined. There are four major psychological
                approaches that propose different functions for <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-181"><em class="firstterm">framework</em></a>: feature- or property-based, geometry-based,
                alignment-based, and transformational.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-651" href="#calibre_link-594" class="calibre1">349</a>]</sup>Each of these psychological definitions or models of similarity has
                analogues in or can be applied to organizing systems.</p><p class="calibre5">An influential model of feature-based similarity calculation is the contrast model
                proposed by <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Amos</span> <span class="calibre1">Tversky</span></span>. This model matches the features or properties of the two things being
                compared and computes a similarity measure according to three sets of features:
                those they share, those the first has that the second lacks, and those that the
                second has that the first lacks. The similarity that results from the set of shared
                features is reduced by the two sets of distinctive features. The weights or
                importance assigned to each of these three sets can be adjusted to explain how items
                are assigned to a set of categories.</p><p class="calibre5">We often use a heuristic version of feature-based similarity calculation when we
                create multi-level or hierarchical category systems to ensure that the categories at
                each level are at the same level of abstraction or breadth. For example, if we were
                organizing a collection of musical instruments, it would not seem correct to have
                subcategories of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">woodwind instruments,</span>”</span>
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">violins,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">cellos</span>”</span> because the feature-based
                similarity among the categories is not the same for all pairwise comparisons among
                the categories; violins and cellos are simply too similar to each other to be
                separate categories given woodwinds as a category.</p><p class="calibre5">Geometric models are a second type of similarity <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-181"><em class="firstterm">framework</em></a>, in which items are represented
                as points in a multi-dimensional feature- or property-space and similarity is
                calculated by measuring the distance between them. How distance is measured depends
                on the type of properties that characterize a domain. When properties that are
                psychologically or perceptually combined, a Euclidean distance function best
                accounts for category judgments; but when properties can be conceptually separated,
                a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">city block</span>”</span> distance function works best to explain psychological
                data, because that ensures that each property value contributes its full amount.
                Geometric similarity functions are commonly used by search engines; if a query and
                document are each represented as a vector of search terms, relevance is determined
                by the distance between the vectors in the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">document space.</span>”</span> We will
                discuss how this works in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-4" title="Chapter 9. Interactions with Resources">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>.</p><p class="calibre5">Alignment-based similarity models have been proposed for domains in which the
                items to be categorized are characterized by abstract or complex relationships with
                their features and with each other. For example, some categories are best understood
                as metaphors that have become conventionalized, and category judgments are made by
                aligning and projecting aspects of one item or entity onto another. With this model
                an entity need not be understood as inherently possessing features shared in common
                with another entity. Rather, people project features from one thing to another in a
                search for congruities between things, much as clue receivers in the second round of
                the <span class="calibre1">Pyramid</span> game search for congruities between examples
                provided by the clue giver in order to guess the target category. For example, a
                clue like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">screaming baby</span>”</span> can suggest many categories, as can
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">parking meter.</span>”</span> But the likely intersection of the interactions
                one can have with babies and parking meters is that they are both <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Things you
                    need to feed.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">Transformational models for calculating similarity assume that the similarity
                between two things is inversely proportional to the complexity of the transformation
                required to turn one into the other. For example, one way to perform the <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-595"><em class="firstterm">name matching</em></a></strong></span> task of determining when two different
                strings denote the same person, object, or other named entity is to calculate the
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">edit distance</span>”</span> between them, the number of changes required to
                transform one into the other. Two strings with a short edit distance might be
                variant spellings or misspellings of the same name.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-652" href="#calibre_link-596" class="calibre1">350</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.3.7 Theory-based Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-534" class="firstname"></a>6.3.7 Theory-based Categories</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-506" class="calibre1"></a>Another principle for creating categories
                    is organizing things in ways that fit a theory or story that makes a particular
                    categorization sensible. A <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-597"><em class="firstterm">theory-based category</em></a></strong></span> can win out even if
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">family resemblance</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">similarity</span>”</span> with respect
                    to visible properties would lead to a different category assignment.</span>
                For example, whales are categorized as mammals by biologists even though they share
                their most visible properties with fish because the theory of
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">mammalness</span>”</span> emphasizes the property of nursing with mother's
                milk.</p><p class="calibre5">Theory-based categories based on origin or causation are especially important with
                highly inventive and computational resources because unlike natural kinds of
                physical resources, little or none of what they can do or how they behave is visible
                on the surface (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-31" title="2.4.1 Affordance and Capability">2.4.1 Affordance and Capability</a>). Consider all of the different
                appearances and form factors of the resources that we categorize as
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">computers</span>”</span> - their essence is that they all compute, an invisible
                or theory-like principle that does not depend on their visible properties.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-653" href="#calibre_link-598" class="calibre1">351</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.3.8 Goal-derived Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-535" class="firstname"></a>6.3.8 Goal-derived Categories</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">A final principle for creating categories is to organize resources that go
                together in order to satisfy a goal. Consider the category <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Things to take
                    from a burning house,</span>”</span> an example that cognitive scientist <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Lawrence</span> <span class="calibre1">Barsalou</span></span> termed an <span class="calibre1">ad hoc</span> or <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">goal-derived</strong></span> category.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-654" href="#calibre_link-599" class="calibre1">352</a>]</sup>What things would you take from your house if your neighborhood were
                burning? Possibly your cat, your wallet and checkbook, your important papers like
                birth certificates and passports, and grandma's old photo album, and anything else
                you think is important, priceless, or irreplaceable <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> as long
                as you can carry it. These items have almost no discernible properties in common,
                except for somehow being your most precious possessions. The category is derived or
                induced by a particular goal in some specified context.</p><p class="calibre5">Similarly, a small towel, a music player with headphones, and a bottle of water
                have no properties in common but they could be organized together because they are
                members of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">things used at the gym when working out</span>”</span> category. This
                category would fit very well with the many <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="firstterm">ad

            resource properties, similarity, and goals. When we use one or more of these principles
            to develop a system of categories, we must make decisions about its depth and breadth.
            Here, we examine the idea that some levels of abstraction in a system of categories are
            more basic or natural than others. We also consider how the choices we make affect how
            we create the organizing system in the first place, and how they shape our interactions
            when we need to find some resources that are categorized in it.</p><div class="book" title="6.4.1 Category Abstraction and Granularity"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-60" class="firstname"></a>6.4.1 Category Abstraction and Granularity</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">We can identify any resource as a unique instance or as a member of a class of
                resources. The size of this class - the number of resources that are treated as
                equivalent - is determined by the properties or characteristics we consider when we
                examine the resources in some domain. The way we think of a resource domain depends
                on context and intent, so the same resource can be thought of abstractly in some
                situations and very concretely in others. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, this influences the nature and extent of resource
                description, and as we've seen in this chapter, it then influences the nature and
                extent of categories we can create.</p><p class="calibre5">Consider the regular chore of putting away clean clothes. We can consider any item
                of clothing as just that <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> a member of a broad category whose
                members are any kind of garment that a person might wear. Using one category for all
                clothing, that is, failing to distinguish among the various items in any useful or
                practical way would likely mean that we would keep our clothes in a big unorganized
                pile.</p><p class="calibre5">However, we cannot wear any random combination of clothing items
                    <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> we need a shirt, a pair of pants, socks, and so on.
                Clearly, our indiscriminate clothing category is too broad for most purposes. So
                instead, most people organize their clothes in more fine-grained categories that fit
                the normal pattern of how they wear clothes. For example, everyone probably
                separates their shirts, pants, and socks when they put away their clothes after
                doing their laundry. Some pants and shirts may merit wooden hangers; others may rest
                in special drawers.</p><p class="calibre5">In <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-529" title="6.3.2 Single Properties">6.3.2 Single Properties</a> we described an organizing system for the
                shirts in our closet, so let's talk about socks instead. When it comes to socks,
                most people think that the basic unit is a pair because they always wear two socks
                at a time. If you are going to need to find socks in pairs, it seems sensible to
                organize them into pairs when you are putting them away. Some people might further
                separate their dress socks from athletic ones, and then sort these socks by color or
                material, creating a hierarchy of sock categories analogous to the shirt categories
                in our previous example. We note, parenthetically, that not everyone works this hard
                when putting their clothes away; some people toss all the single, unpaired socks in
                a drawer and then rummage around when they need to find a matching pair of socks.
                People differ in their preferences or tolerances for the amount of granularity in an
                organizing system and we need to expect and respect these differences.</p><p class="calibre5">Questions of resource abstraction and granularity also emerge whenever the
                information systems of different firms, or different parts of a firm, need to
                exchange information or be merged into a single system. All parties must define the
                identity of each thing in the same way, or in ways that can be related or mapped to
                each other either manually or electronically.</p><p class="calibre5">For example, how should a business system deal with a customer's address? Printed
                on an envelope, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">an address</span>”</span> typically appears as a comprehensive,
                multi-line text object. Inside an information system, however, an address is stored
                as separate information components for each printed line, or as a set of distinctly
                identifiable information components. This fine-grained organization makes it easier
                to sort customers by city or postal codes, for sales and marketing purposes.
                Incompatibilities in the abstraction and granularity of these information
                components, and the ways in which they are presented and reused in documents, will
                cause interoperability problems when businesses need to share information, some of
                which may be difficult to detect because of the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-66"><em class="firstterm">vocabulary problem</em></a>.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-655" href="#calibre_link-600" class="calibre1">353</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.4.2 Basic or Natural Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-537" class="firstname"></a>6.4.2 Basic or Natural Categories</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">We can describe category abstraction in terms of a hierarchy of <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">superordinate</em></strong></span>,

                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">socks</span>”</span> are basic categories, and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white long-sleeve dress
                    shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white wool hiking socks</span>”</span> are subordinate
                categories. Members of basic level categories like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">shirts</span>”</span> and
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">socks</span>”</span> have many perceptual properties in common, and are more
                strongly associated with motor movements than members of superordinate categories.
                Members of subordinate categories have many common properties, but these properties
                are also shared by members of other subordinate categories at the same level of
                abstraction in the category hierarchy. That is, while we can identify many
                properties shared by all <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white long-sleeve dress shirts,</span>”</span> many of them
                are also properties of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">blue long-sleeve dress shirts</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">black

                categories are more basic or natural than others. An implication for organizing
                system design is that basic level categories are highly efficient in terms of the
                cognitive effort they take to create and use.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-656" href="#calibre_link-601" class="calibre1">354</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="6.4.3 The Recall and Precision Tradeoff"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-538" class="firstname"></a>6.4.3 The Recall and Precision Tradeoff</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The abstraction level we choose determines how precisely we identify resources.
                When we want to make a general claim, or communicate that the scope of our interest
                is broad, we use superordinate categories, as when we ask, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">How many animals
                    are in the <span class="calibre1">San Diego Zoo</span>?</span>”</span> But we use precise

                described or arranged with this level of detail, a similarly detailed specification
                of the resources you are looking for yields precisely what you want. When you get to
                the place where you keep white wool hiking socks, you find all of them and nothing
                else. On the other hand, if all your socks are tossed unsorted into a sock drawer,
                when you go sock hunting you might not be able to find the socks you want and you
                will encounter lots of socks you do not want. But you won't have put time into
                sorting them, which many people don't enjoy doing; you can spend time sorting or
                searching depending on your preferences.</p><p class="calibre5">If we translate this example into the jargon of information retrieval, we say that
                more fine-grained organization reduces <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">recall</em></strong></span>, the number of resources you
                find or retrieve in response to a query, but increases the <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">precision</em></strong></span> of the recalled
                set, the proportion of recalled items that are relevant. Broader or coarse-grained
                categories increase recall, but lower precision. We are all too familiar with this
                hard bargain when we use a web search engine; a quick one-word query results in many
                pages of mostly irrelevant sites, whereas a carefully crafted multi-word query
                pinpoints sites with the information we seek. We will discuss recall, precision, and

                retrieval. A tradeoff between the investment in organization and the investment in
                retrieval persists in nearly every organizing system. The more effort we put into
                organizing resources, the more effectively they can be retrieved. The more effort we
                are willing to put into retrieving resources, the less they need to be organized
                first. The allocation of costs and benefits between the organizer and retriever
                differs according to the relationship between them. Are they the same person? Who

                might be determining what constitutes a language, since there is no widespread
                agreement on what differentiates a language from a dialect, or even on whether such

                use the language they learn, or on which teachers are available. For the purposes of
                a school teaching global languages, one of the standard varieties of English (which
                are associated with more political power), or an amalgamation of standard varieties
                might be thought of as an instance (<span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">English</span>”</span>) of the category
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Languages.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">Similarly, the category structure in which <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Chinese</span>”</span> is situated can
                vary with context. While some schools might not conceptualize <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Chinese</span>”</span>
                as a category encompassing multiple linguistic varieties, but rather as a single
                instance within the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Languages</span>”</span> category, another school might teach
                its students Mandarin, Wu, and Cantonese as dialects within the language category
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Chinese,</span>”</span> that are unified by a single standard <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-603"><em class="firstterm">writing system</em></a>. In addition, a

                for the purpose of creating a principled language classification system.</p><p class="calibre5">In fact languages can be categorized in multitude of ways. If we are concerned
                with linguistic diversity and the survival of minority languages, we might
                categorize some languages as endangered in order to mobilize language preservation
                efforts. We could also categorize languages in terms of shared linguistic ancestors
                    (<span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Romance languages,</span>”</span> for example), in terms of what kinds of
                sounds they make use of, by how well we speak them, by regions they are commonly
                spoken in, whether they are signed or unsigned, and so on. We could also expand our
                definition of the languages category to include artificial computer languages, or
                body language, or languages shared by people and their pets <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span>
                or thinking more metaphorically, we might include the language of fashion.</p><p class="calibre5">If people could only categorize in a single way, the <span class="calibre1">Pyramid</span>™ game show, where contestants guess what category is

                creative possibilities provided by categorization allow people to order the world
                and refer to interrelationships among conceptions through a kind of allusive
                shorthand. When we talk about the language of fashion, we suggest that in the

            problems, or organize our kitchens and clothes closets. Sometimes categories are more
            apparent, as when we see signs and labels in the aisles of department or grocery stores
            to help us find things, when we put our socks and t-shirts in different dresser drawers,

            briefly discuss some of the most important technologies for implementing categories,

                    learning.</span> In supervised learning, a machine learning program is trained
                by giving it sample items or documents that are labeled by category, and the program
                learns to assign new items to the correct categories. In unsupervised learning, the

                return to supervised learning in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56" title="Chapter 7. Classification: Assigning Resources to Categories">Chapter&nbsp;7</a>,
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Classification.</span>”</span></p><p class="calibre5">There are far too many unsupervised learning techniques for categorization to even
                mention them all, let alone describe how they work. The ones that are most relevant
                for us are called <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-615"><em class="firstterm">clustering</em></a></strong></span> techniques and they
                all share the same goal and a few basic methods. <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-337" class="calibre1"></a>The
                    shared goal of clustering is to create meaningful categories from a collection
                    of items whose properties are hard to directly perceive and evaluate; this is
                    especially true with large collections of heterogeneous documents, where goals
                    might be to find categories of documents with the same topics, genre, sentiment,
                    or other characteristic that cannot easily be reduced to specific property
                    tests.</span></p><p class="calibre5">The first shared method is that clustering techniques start with an initially
                uncategorized set of items or documents from which some measures of inter-item
                similarity can be calculated.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-665" href="#calibre_link-616" class="calibre1">362</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">The second shared method is that categories are created by putting items that are
                most similar into the same category. <span class="calibre1">Hierarchical clustering
                    approaches</span> start with every item in its own category. Other approaches,
                notably one called <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">K-means clustering,</span>”</span> start with a fixed
                number of K categories initialized with a randomly chosen item or document.</p><p class="calibre5">The third shared method is refining the system of categories by iterative
                similarity recalculation each time an item is added to a category. Approaches that
                start with every item in its own category create a hierarchical system of categories
                by merging the two most similar categories, recomputing the similarity between the
                new category and the remaining ones, and repeating this process until all the
                categories are merged into a single category at the root of a category tree.
                Techniques that start with a fixed number of categories do not create new ones but
                instead repeatedly recalculate the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">center</span>”</span> of the category by
                adjusting its property representation to the average of all its members after a new
                member is added.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-666" href="#calibre_link-617" class="calibre1">363</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">The end result of clustering is a statistically optimal set of categories in which
                the similarity of all the items within a category is larger than the similarity of
                items that belong to different categories. This is a statistical result produced by
                a computer, and there is no guarantee that the categories are meaningful ones that
                can be named and used by people. In the end, clustering relies on the data analyst
                or information scientist to make sense of the clusters if they are to be used to
                classify resources. In many cases it is better to start with categories created by
                people and then teach them to computers that can use supervised learning techniques
                to assign new resources to the categories.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="6.6 Key Points in Chapter Six"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre8"></div><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-542" class="firstname"></a>6.6 Key Points in Chapter Six</h1></div></div></div><div class="book"><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre5">Categories are equivalence classes: sets or groups of things or abstract

                    Bruner's (1957) classic phrase. In contrast, the discipline of organizing
                    focuses on the explicit and self-aware mechanisms for creating and using
                    categories because by definition, organizing systems serve intentional and often

                    top-down processing to simulate the time course and results of categorization at
                    both fine-grained scales (as in word or object recognition) and over

                    cognitive representations in which categories are explicit structures in memory
                    with associated instances and properties. In contrast, generalized learning

                    weighting of connections in neural processing networks that are not specialized
                    for language in any way. Computational simulations of semantic networks can

                    semantic judgments that have been used as evidence for explicit category
                    representations without needing anything like them. Rogers and McClelland (2004)

                    how children learn categories and categorization methods. Most psychologists
                    argue that category learning starts with general learning mechanisms that are
                    very perceptually based, but they don't agree whether to characterize these

                    system. Over time more specific learning techniques evolve that focus on
                    correlations among perceptual properties (things with wings tend to have
                    feathers), correlations among properties and roles (things with eyes tend to
                    eat), and ultimately correlations among roles (things that eat tend to sleep).

                        have argued that the existence of perceptual discontinuities is not
                        sufficient to account for category formation. Instead, people assume that
                        members of a biological category must have an essence of co-occurring
                        properties and these guide people to focus on the salient differences,
                        thereby creating categories. Property clusters enable inferences about
                        causality, which then builds a framework on which additional categories can
                        be created and refined. For example, if <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">having wings</span>”</span> and

                        object like a banana is very large. We can pick, peel, slice, smash, eat, or
                        throw a banana, so instead of capturing this complexity in the meaning of
                        banana it gets parceled into the verbs that can act on the banana noun.
                        Doing so requires languages to use verbs to capture a broader and more
                        abstract type of meaning that is determined by the nouns they are combined
                        with. Familiar verbs like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">set</span>”</span>, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">put</span>”</span>, and

            most often created in abstract and information-intensive domains where unambiguous and
            precise categories enable <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-419"><em class="firstterm">classification</em></a> to be purposeful and

                reference model or conceptual roadmap for its users. This classification creates the
                structure and support for the interactions that human or computational agents
                perform.</span> For example, research libraries and bookstores do not use the same
            classifications to organize books, but the categories they each use are appropriate for
            their contrasting types of collections and the different kinds of browsing and searching
            activities that take place in each context. Likewise, the scientific classifications for

                not classification, because the other tags that would serve as the alternative
                classifications are unspecified. Furthermore, when tagging principles are followed
                at all, they are likely to be idiosyncratic ones that were not pre-determined or
                arrived at through an analysis of goals and requirements.</p><p class="calibre5">Noticeably, some uses of tags treat them as category labels, turning tagging into
                classification. Many web sites and resources encourage users to assign
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Like</span>”</span> or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">+1</span>”</span> tags to them, and because these tags
                are pre-defined, they are category choices in an implied classification system; for
                example, we can consider <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Like</span>”</span> as an alternative to a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Not liked

                invented to describe more systematic tagging. For example, a tagsonomy could
                predetermine tags as categories to be assigned to particular contents of a blog
                post, or specify the level of abstraction and granularity for assigning tags without
                predetermining them (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-536" title="6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications">6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications</a>). Some people use multiple user
                accounts for the same application to establish distinct personas or contexts (e.g.,

                putting it in some physical or digital storage location. This focus on the logical

                conventional usage in library science, where classification is mostly associated
                with arranging tangible items on shelves, emphasizing the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">parking</span>”</span>
                function that realizes the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">marking</span>”</span> function of identifying the

                that when the resources being classified are physical or tangible things such as
                books, paintings, animals, or cooking pots, the end result of the classification
                activity is that some resource has been placed in some physical location. Moreover,
                the placement of physical resources can be influenced by the physical context in
                which they are organized. Once placed, the physical context often embodies some
                aspects of the organization when similar or related resources are arranged in nearby
                locations. In libraries and bookstores, this adjacency facilitates the serendipitous
                discovery of resources, as anyone well knows who has found an interesting book by
                browsing the shelves.</p><p class="calibre5">It might seem natural to identify storage locations with the classes used by the
                classification system. Just as we might think of a location in the zoo as the

                row of shelves in a library where books about physics are arranged.</p><p class="calibre5">However, once we broaden the scope of organizing to include digital resources, it
                is clear that we rely on their logical classifications when we interact with them,
                not whether they reside on a computer in Berkeley or Bangalore. It is better to
                emphasize that a classification system is foremost a specification for the logical
                arrangement of resources because there are usually many possible and often arbitrary
                mappings of logical references to physical locations.</p></div><div class="book" title="7.1.4 Classification Schemes"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-1476" class="firstname"></a>7.1.4 Classification Schemes</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">A classification scheme is a realization of one or more organizing principles.
                Physical resources are often classified according to their tangible or perceivable
                properties. As we discussed in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-529" title="6.3.2 Single Properties">6.3.2 Single Properties</a> and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-530" title="6.3.3 Multiple Properties">6.3.3 Multiple Properties</a>, when properties take on only a small set of discrete
                values, a classification system naturally emerges in which each category is defined
                by one property value or some particular combination of property values. <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-371" class="calibre1"></a>Classification schemes in which all possible

                enumerative classification for a personal collection of music recorded on
                    <span class="calibre1">physical media</span> might have categories for

                    considered in a fixed sequence, each property creates another level in the
                    system of categories and the classification scheme is <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2367" href="#calibre_link-1490"><em class="firstterm">hierarchical</em></a></strong></span> or <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">taxonomic</strong></span>.</span> (See <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-1439" title="5.3.1.1 Inclusion">5.3.1.1 Inclusion</a>.)

                <span class="calibre1">planning a new course</span> might <span class="calibre1">organize candidate

                potential lecture topic. It can be challenging to <span class="calibre1">enumerate</span> all the
                subjects or topics that a collection of resources might be about. The <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Library of Congress Classification</span>(LCC)</span> is a hierarchical and enumerative scheme with a very detailed set of
                subject categories because books can be about almost anything. We discuss the

                are sometimes organized using intrinsic properties like author names or creation
                dates. Our professor might primarily organize his collection of articles by author
                name, and when he plans a new course, he might put those he selects for the syllabus
                into a classification system with one category for every scheduled lecture.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-403" class="calibre1"></a>Because names and dates can take on a
                    great many values, an organizing principle like alphabetical or chronological
                    ordering is unlikely to enumerate in advance an explicit category for each
                    possible value. Instead, we can consider these organizing principles as creating
                    an <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">implicit or latent</strong></span> classification system
                    in which the categories are generated only as needed. For example, the Q
                    category only exists in an alphabetical scheme if there is a resource whose name
                    starts with Q.</span></p><p class="calibre5">Many resource domains have multiple properties that might be used to define a
                classification scheme. For example, <span class="calibre1">wine</span> can be classified by
                type of <span class="calibre1">grape</span> (varietal), color, flavor, price, winemaker,
                region of origin (appellation), blending style, and other properties. Furthermore,
                people differ in their knowledge or preferences about these properties; some people
                choose wine based on its price and varietal, while others studiously compare
                winemakers and appellations. Each order of considering the properties creates a
                different hierarchical classification, and using all of them would create a very
                deep and unwieldy system. Moreover, many different hierarchies might be required to
                satisfy divergent preferences. An alternative classification scheme for domains like
                these is <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">faceted</strong></span> classification, a type of
                classification system that takes a set of resource properties and then
                    <span class="calibre1">generates</span> only those categories for combinations that actually

            classification of diseases facilitates diagnosis and development of medical procedures,

            skills for it.</p><p class="calibre5">In the discipline of organizing we consider classification to be systematic when it
            follows principles that govern the structure of categories and their relationships.
            However, being systematic and principled does not necessarily ensure that a
            classification will be unbiased or satisfy all users' requirements. For example, the
            zoning, environmental, economic development, and political district classifications that
            overlay different parts of a city determine the present and future allocation of
            services and resources, and over time influence whether the city thrives or decays.
            These classifications reflect tradeoffs and negotiations among numerous participants,
            including businesses, lobbyists, incumbent politicians, donors to political parties,

                doing so differentiates among them. However, bringing resources together would be
                pointless without reasons for finding, accessing, and interacting with them

                    organizing systems within the domain. Standard classifications like those used
                    in libraries enable people to rely on one system that they can use to locate
                    resources in many libraries. Standard business, job, and product classifications

                including enumeration, single properties, multiple properties and hierarchy, family
                resemblance, similarity, theory and goal-based categorization. It logically follows
                that the principles considered in designing categories are embodied in
                classifications that use those categories. However, when we say,
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">classification is principled,</span>”</span> we are going further to say that
                the processes of assigning resources to categories and maintaining the
                classification scheme over time must also follow principles.</p><p class="calibre5">The design and use of a classification system involves many choices about its
                purposes, scope, scale, intended lifetime, extensibility, and other considerations.
                Principled classification means that once those design choices are made they should
                be systematically and consistently followed.</p><p class="calibre5">Principled does not necessarily equate to <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">good,</span>”</span> because many of the
                choices can be arbitrary and others may involve tradeoffs that depend on the nature
                of the resources, the purposes of the classification, the amount of effort
                available, and the capabilities of the people doing the classification and of the
                people using it (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-536" title="6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications">6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications</a>). Every classification system is
                biased in one way or another (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-1448" title="7.3 Bibliographic Classification">7.3 Bibliographic Classification</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">Consider the classifications of resources in a highly-organized kitchen. Tableware
                (forks, spoons and cutlery) is usually kept together in a single drawer, separated
                by utensil type with a flatware organizer. Dishes are stacked on a cabinet shelf.
                Pots and pans are nested to save space, spices are alphabetized in a spice rack,
                items used for baking are on the same shelf, and coffee is next to the coffee maker.
                Items used frequently may be in more accessible areas<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>on top
                in drawers, lower cabinets, and shelves<span class="calibre1">&mdash;</span>than items used
                infrequently, which end up on high shelves or pushed to the back of cabinets. This
                classification system is not documented with a written specification and the person
                who created and uses it did not study principles of kitchen classification in
                school, but when she cleans up the kitchen after making a meal, everything goes back
                where it came from, making it easy to find necessary resources the next time she
                cooks. Other people might have different classifications of kitchen resources, and
                some people might use much simpler classification schemes because they do not cook
                often and do not mind rummaging around to find what they need when they do.</p><p class="calibre5">On the other hand, complex institutional classification systems like those used in
                libraries or government agencies are implemented with detailed specifications,
                methods, and guidelines. The people who apply them probably did study them in school
                or received extensive on-the-job training to ensure they apply them correctly and

                    and depth of the category hierarchy. We discussed this in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-536" title="6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications">6.4 Category Design Choices and Implications</a> but in the context of classification this principle
                    has additional implications and is framed as the extent to which the scheme is

                    depends largely on the variety or heterogeneity of the resources that the system
                    of categories has been designed to organize. Because of the diversity of
                    resources for a sale in a department store, a broad classification is necessary
                    to accommodate everything in the store. Kitchen goods will be grouped together
                    in a few aisles on a single floor. But a specialty kitchen store or a wholesale
                    kitchen supply store for restaurants would classify much more precisely because
                    of the restricted resource domain and the greater expertise of those who want to
                    buy things there. An entire section might be dedicated just to knives, organized
                    by knife type, manufacturer, quality of steel, and other categories that are not
                    used in the kitchen section of the department store.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2169" href="#calibre_link-2101" class="calibre1">388</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">The precision or enumerativeness of a classification scheme increases the
                    similarity of resources that are assigned to the same category and sharpens the
                    distinctions between resources in different categories. However, when different
                    classifications must be combined, mismatches in their precision or granularity
                    can create challenges (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-14" title="9.3 Organizing Resources for Interactions">9.3 Organizing Resources for Interactions</a>).</p></div><div class="book" title="7.2.2.2 Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2376" class="firstname"></a>7.2.2.2 Principles for Assigning Resources to Categories</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-509" class="calibre1"></a>The <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2377" href="#calibre_link-711"><em class="firstterm">uniqueness

                        classification scheme are mutually exclusive. Thus, when a logical concept
                        is assigned to a particular category, it cannot simultaneously be assigned
                        to another category.</span> Resources, however, can be assigned several
                    categories if they embody several concepts represented by those different
                    categories. This can present a challenge when a physical storage solution is
                    based on storing resources according to its assigned category in a logical
                    classification system. This is not a serious problem for resource types like
                    technical equipment or tools, for which the properties used to classify them are
                    highly salient, and that have very narrow and predictable contexts of use. It is
                    also not a problem for highly-specialized information resources like scientific
                    research reports or government economic data, which might end up in only one
                    specialized class. However, many resources are inherently more difficult to
                    classify because they have less salient properties or because they have many
                    more possible uses.</p><p class="calibre5">We face this kind of problem all the time. For example, should we store a pair
                    of scissors in the kitchen or in the office? One solution is to buy a second
                    pair of scissors so that scissors can be kept in both locations where they are
                    typically used, but this is not practical for many types of resources and this
                    principle would be difficult to apply in a systematic manner.</p><p class="calibre5">Many books are about multiple subjects. A self-help book about coping with
                    change in a business setting might reasonably be classified as either about
                    applied psychology or about business. It is not helpful that book titles are
                    often poor clues to their content; <em class="firstterm">Who Moved My Cheese?</em>

                    it is kept in the business school library.</p><p class="calibre5">The general solution to satisfying the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-711"><em class="firstterm">uniqueness principle</em></a> in
                    library classifications when resources do not clearly fit in a single category
                    is to invent and follow a detailed set of often arbitrary rules. Usually, the
                    primary subject of the book is used for assigning a category, which will then
                    determine the book's place on a shelf. However, a rule might also state that if
                    a book treats two subjects equally, the subject that is covered first determines
                    the classification. For some classifications a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">table of
                        preference</span>”</span> can trump other rules at the last minute. Not
                    surprisingly, the rules for categorizing books take a long time to learn and are
                    not always easy to apply.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2170" href="#calibre_link-2102" class="calibre1">389</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="7.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2378" class="firstname"></a>7.2.2.3 Principles for Maintaining the Classification over Time</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The classification schemes in your kitchen or closet are deconstructed and
                    disappear when you move and take your possessions to a different house or
                    apartment. Your efforts to re-implement the classifications will be influenced
                    by the configuration of shelves and cabinets in your new residence, so they will
                    not be exactly the same. Most personal classifications are created in response
                    to a specific situation to solve an emerging organizational challenge. As a
                    consequence, personal classification systems change in an <span {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="calibre1"><em {http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}lang="latin" class="firstterm">ad hoc</em></span> or opportunistic manner during their
                    limited lifetimes.</p><p class="calibre5">In contrast, the institutional classification schemes for many library
                    resources, culturally or scientifically-important artifacts, and much of the
                    information created or collected by businesses, governments and researchers
                    might have useful lives of decades or centuries. Classification systems like
                    these can only be changed incrementally to avoid disruption of the work flows of
                    the organization. We described maintaining resources as an activity in all
                    organizing systems (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-237" title="2.5 Maintaining Resources">2.5 Maintaining Resources</a>) and the issues of
                    persistence, effectivity, authenticity, and provenance that emerge with
                    resources over time (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-924" title="3.5 Resources Over Time">3.5 Resources Over Time</a>). Much of this previous
                    discussion applies in a straightforward manner to maintaining classifications
                    over time.</p><p class="calibre5">However, some additional issues arise with classifications over time. The most
                    important one is that the meaning of an underlying category can change, along
                    with its relative and absolute importance with respect to the other categories
                    in the classification system. Categories sometimes change slowly, but they can
                    also change quickly and radically as a result of technological, process, or
                    geopolitical innovation or events. Entirely new types of resources and bodies of
                    knowledge can appear in a short time. Consider what the categories of
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">travel,</span>”</span>
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">entertainment,</span>”</span>

                    to just a decade or two ago.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-427" class="calibre1"></a>Changes in the meaning of the categories in a
                        classification threaten its <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2379" href="#calibre_link-1493"><em class="firstterm">integrity</em></a></strong></span>, the principle that categories should
                        not move within the structure of the classification
                        system.</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2171" href="#calibre_link-2103" class="calibre1">390</a>]</sup> One way to maintain integrity while adapting to the dynamic and
                    changing nature of knowledge is to define a new version of a classification
                    system while allowing earlier ones to persist, which preserves resource
                    assignments in the previous version of the classification system while allowing
                    it to change in the new one. If we adopt a logical perspective on classification
                        (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-708" title="7.1.2 Classification vs. Tagging">7.1.2 Classification vs. Tagging</a>) that dissociates the conceptual assignment
                    of resources to categories from their physical arrangement, there is no reason
                    why a resource cannot have contrasting category assignments in different
                    versions of a classification.</p><p class="calibre5">However, the conventional library with collections of physical resources
                    cannot easily abandon its requirement to use a classification to arrange books
                    on shelves in specific places so they can be located, checked out, and returned
                    to the same location. This constraint does not preclude the versioning of
                    library classifications, but it increases the inertia and limits the degree of
                    change when revisions are made because of the cost and coordination
                    considerations of rearranging books in all the world's libraries.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-382" class="calibre1"></a>A related principle about

                    to accommodate the books, clothes, or files you will acquire over some future
                    timeframe. As with other choices that need to be made about organizing systems,

                people making them. As a result, every system of classification is biased because it

                allowed the government to report that unemployment was about 8% and falling, when in

                        or more distinct items in their collections, and they almost all use the
                        same standard bibliographic classification system that has about 300,000

                        locations, and re-shelving that they support. These requirements constrain
                        the evolution and extensibility of bibliographic classifications, making
                        them less able to keep pace with changing concepts and new bodies of
                        knowledge. Amazon classifies the products it sells in huge warehouses, but
                        its customers do not have to pick out their purchases there, and most goods
                        never return to the warehouse. <span class="calibre1">Amazon</span> can add new product

            resources are assigned to categories and how the classification can evolve over time.
                <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">Faceted
                classifications</em></strong></span> are an alternative that overcome some of
            these limitations. <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-378" class="calibre1"></a>In a faceted classification
                system, each resource is described using properties from multiple facets, but an
                agent searching for resources does not need to consider all of the properties (and
                consequently the facets) and does not need to consider them in a fixed order, which
                an enumerative hierarchical classification requires.</span> Faceted
            classifications are especially useful in web user interfaces for online shopping or for
            browsing a large and heterogeneous museum collection. The process of considering facets
            in any order and ignoring those that are not relevant implies a dynamic organizational
            structure that makes selection both flexible and efficient. We can best illustrate these
            advantages with a shopping example in a domain that we are familiar with from <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-530" title="6.3.3 Multiple Properties">6.3.3 Multiple Properties</a>.</p><p class="calibre5">If a department store offers shirts in various styles, colors, sizes, brands, and
            prices, shoppers might want to search and sort through them using properties from these
            facets in any order. However, in a physical store, this is not possible because the
            shirts must be arranged in actual locations in the store, with dress shirts in one area,
            work shirts in another, and so on.</p><p class="calibre5">Assume that the shirt store has shirts in four styles: dress shirts, work shirts,
            party shirts, and athletic shirts. The dress shirts come in white and blue, the work
            shirts in white and brown, and the party and athletic shirts come in white, blue, brown,
            and red. White dress shirts come in large and medium sizes.</p><p class="calibre5">Suppose we are looking for a white dress shirt in a large size. We can think of this
            desired shirt in two equivalent ways, either as a member of a category of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">large
                white dress shirts</span>”</span> or a shirt with <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">dress,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white,</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">large</span>”</span> values on style, color, and size facets.
            Because of the way the shirts are arranged in the physical store, our search process has
            to follow a hierarchical structure of categories. We go to the dress shirt section, find
            the white shirts, and then look within the white shirts for a large one. This process
            corresponds to the hierarchy shown in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-2123" title="Figure 7-3. Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet">Figure&nbsp;7-3</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-2123" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2383" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000005.jpg" alt="Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color Facet" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;7-3.&nbsp;Enumerative Classification with Style Facet Followed by Color
                Facet</p></div><p class="calibre5">Although unlikely, a store might choose to organize its shirts by color. In our search
            for a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">white dress shirt in a large size,</span>”</span> if we consider the color first,
            because shirts come in four colors, there are four color categories to choose from. When
            we choose the white shirts, there is no category for work shirts because there are no
            work shirts that come in white. We then choose the dress shirts, and then finally find
            the large one (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-2124" title="Figure 7-4. Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by Style Facet">Figure&nbsp;7-4</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">This department store example shows that for a physical organization, one property
            facet guides the localization of resources; all other facets are subordinated under the
            primary organizing property. In hierarchical enumerative classifications, this means
            that the primary organizing facet determines the primary form of access. The shirts are
            either organized by style and then color, or by color then style, which enforces an
            inflexible query strategy (either first by style or first by color).</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-2124" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2384" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000019.jpg" alt="Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by Style Facet" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;7-4.&nbsp;Enumerative Classification with Color Facet Followed by Style
                Facet</p></div><p class="calibre5">In an online store, however, descriptions of the shirts are being searched and sorted
            instead of the real shirts, and different organizations are possible. When the shirts
            are described using a faceted classification system, we treat all facets independently,
            i.e. they can all be the primary facet.</p><p class="calibre5">We can enumerate all the properties needed to assign resources appropriately, but we
            create the categories (i.e. combination of properties from different facets) only if
            they are needed to sort resources with a particular combination of properties.</p><p class="calibre5">An additional aspect of the flexibility of faceted classification is that a facet can
            be left out of a resource description if it is not needed or appropriate. For example,
            because party shirts are often multi-colored with exotic patterns, it is not that useful
            to describe their color. Likewise, certain types of athletic shirts might be very
            loose-fitting, and as a result not be given a size description, but their color is
            important because it is tied to a particular team. <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-2125" title="Figure 7-5. Faceted Classification.

            instead of having to adhere to whatever predetermined (pre-combined) enumerative
            classification the store came up with. In a digital organizing system, faceted
            classification enables highly flexible access because prioritizing different facets can

                classification system and notation, considering it his dharma (the closest

            places, and arrange them in activity-based groups in the preparation area?<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-2202" href="#calibre_link-2140" class="calibre1">421</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Looking at the relationship between tasks and tools in this way can help a cook
            determine the best way to organize tools in a kitchen. Cutting items would necessarily

            learning technique known as clustering to create a system of categories for classifying
            a set of resources or documents for which measures of inter-item similarity can be
            calculated. Clustering programs do not start with a set of resources that are already
            classified, making them <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">unsupervised</strong></span> techniques. The
            categories they create maximize the similarity of resources within a category and
            maximize the differences between them, but these statistically-designed categories are
            not always meaningful ones that can be named and used by people. We ended <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> by suggesting that it is often better to start with a designed

                        into 1815. The persistence of an inaccurate name for this war reflects its
                        unique characteristics. Wars (in the English language) are generally named
                        for the location of the fighting or the enemy being fought (the
                        Mexican-American War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War), or for
                        a particular ideal or ambition (the Revolutionary War, the Civil War). The
                        War of 1812 does not satisfy any of these naming conventions; the war was
                        fought across a huge range of geography from eastern Canada to Louisiana,
                        between a diverse range of groups from Canadians and Native American tribes,
                        with national armies getting involved very late in the war. While nominally
                        fought over freedom the seas, the war quickly morphed into one about
                        territorial ambition in North America. Of course, if the world were a place
                        where people could agree on naming standards for wars, it is likely we would
                        no longer have wars. See

            fundamental organizing principles, application-specific concepts, and details of
            implementation. The three-tier architecture we introduced in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-161" title="1.2.3.1 The Concept of Organizing Principle">1.2.3.1 The Concept of Organizing Principle</a> is one way to conceptualize this separation. In <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-693" title="5.7 The Implementation Perspective for Analyzing Relationships">5.7 The Implementation Perspective for Analyzing Relationships</a>, we contrasted the implementation-focused perspective for
            analyzing relationships with other perspectives that focus on the meaning and abstract
            structure of relationships. In this chapter, we present this contrast between
            conceptualization and implementation in terms of separating the
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">content</em></span> and <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-694"><em class="firstterm">form</em></a></em></span> of resource descriptions.</p><p class="calibre5">In the previous chapters, we have considered principles and concepts of organizing in
            many different contexts, ranging from personal organizing systems to cultural and
            institutional ones. We have noted that some organizing systems have limited scope and
            expected lifetime, such as a task-oriented personal organizing system, like a shopping
            list. Other organizing systems support broad uses that rely on standard categories
            developed through rigorous processes, like a product catalog.</p><p class="calibre5">By this point you should have a good sense of the various conceptual issues you need
            to consider when deciding how to describe a resource in order to meet the goals of your
            organizing system. Considering those issues will give you some sense of what the content
            of your descriptions should be. In order to focus on the conceptual issues, we have
            deferred discussion of specific implementation issues. Implementation involves choosing
            the specific form of your descriptions, and that is the topic of this chapter.</p><p class="calibre5">We can approach the problem of how to form resource descriptions from two
            perspectives: structuring and writing. From one perspective, resource descriptions are
            things that are <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">used</em></span> by both people and computational agents. From
            this perspective, choosing the form of resource descriptions is a kind of design. This
            is easy to see for certain kinds of resource descriptions, like the signs and maps found
            in physical environments like airport terminals, public libraries, and malls. In these
            spaces, resource descriptions are quite literally designed to help people orient
            themselves and find their way. But any kind of resource description, not just those
            embedded in the built environment, can be viewed as a designed object. Designing an
            object involves making decisions about how it should be structured so that it can best
            be used for its intended purpose. From a design perspective, choosing the form of a
            resource description means making decisions about its
            <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">structure</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">In <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-695" title="5.5 The Structural Perspective for Analyzing Relationships">5.5 The Structural Perspective for Analyzing Relationships</a>, we took a structural perspective on <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-184"><em class="firstterm">resources</em></a> and the relationships among them. In
            this chapter, we will take a structural perspective on resource
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">descriptions</em></span>. The difference is subtle but important. A
            structural perspective on resource <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">relationships</em></span> focuses on how
            people or computational processes associate, arrange, and connect those resources. A
            structural perspective on resource <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">descriptions</em></span> focuses on how
            those associations, arrangements, and connections are explicitly represented or
            implemented in the descriptions we create. Mismatches between the structure imposed on
            the resources being organized and the structure of the descriptions used to implement
            that organization could result in an organizing system that is complex, inefficient, and
            difficult to maintain, as you will see in our first example.</p><p class="calibre5">The structures of resource descriptions enable or inhibit particular ways of
            interacting with those descriptions, just as the descriptions themselves enable or
            inhibit particular ways of interacting with the described resources (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-696" title="2.4 Designing Resource-Based Interactions">2.4 Designing Resource-Based Interactions</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-4" title="Chapter 9. Interactions with Resources">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>). Keep in mind that
            resource descriptions are themselves information resources. So, much of what we will say
            in this chapter is applicable to the structures and forms of information resources in
            general. Put another way, the structure and form of information resources informs the
            design of resource descriptions. </p><p class="calibre5">From another perspective, creating resource descriptions is a kind of
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">writing</span>”</span>. I may describe something to you orally, but such a
            description might not be very useful to an organizing system unless it were transcribed.
            Organizing systems need persistent descriptions, and that means they need to be written.
            In that sense, choosing the form of a resource description means making decisions about
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">notation</em></span> and <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">syntax</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">Modern Western culture tends to make a sharp distinction between designing and
            writing, but there are areas where this distinction breaks down, and the creation of
            resource descriptions in <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                systems</em></a> is one of them. In the following sections, we will use designing
            and writing as two lenses for looking at the problem of how to choose the form of
            resource descriptions. Specifically, we will examine the spectrum of options we have for
            structuring descriptions, and the kinds of syntaxes we have for writing those
            descriptions.</p></div><div class="book" title="8.2 Structuring Descriptions"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-680" class="firstname"></a>8.2 Structuring Descriptions</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Choosing how to structure resource descriptions is a matter of making principled and
            purposeful design decisions in order to solve specific problems, serve specific
            purposes, or bring about some desirable property in the descriptions. Most of these
            decisions are specific to a <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">domain</em></span>: the particular context of
            application for the organizing system being designed and the kinds of interactions with
            resources it will enable. Making these kinds of context-specific decisions results in a
            model of that domain (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-697" title="4.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description">4.3.1.2 Abstraction in Resource Description</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">Over time, many people have built similar kinds of descriptions. They have had similar
            purposes, desired similar properties, and faced similar problems. Unsurprisingly, they
            have converged on some of the same decisions. <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-449" class="calibre1"></a>When common
                sets of design decisions can be identified that are not specific to any one domain,
                they often become systematized in textbooks and in design practices, and may
                eventually be designed into standard formats and architectures for creating
                organizing systems. These formally recognized sets of design decisions are known as
                    <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-698"><em class="firstterm">abstract models</em></a></strong></span> or
                    <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2394" href="#calibre_link-485"><em class="firstterm">metamodels</em></a></strong></span>. Metamodels describe structures commonly
                found in resource descriptions and other information resources, regardless of the
                specific domain.</span> While any designer of an organizing system will usually
            create a model of her specific domain, she usually will not create an entirely new
            metamodel but will instead make choices from among the metamodels that have been
            formally recognized and incorporated into existing standards. The resulting model is
            sometimes called a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">domain-specific language</span>”</span>. Reusing
            standard metamodels can bring great economical advantages, as developers can reuse tools
            designed for and knowledge about these metamodels, rather than having to start from
            scratch.</p><p class="calibre5">In the following sections, we will examine some common kinds of structures used as the
            basis for metamodels. But first, we will consider a concrete example of how the
            structure of resource descriptions supports or inhibits particular uses. As we explained
            in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-46" title="Chapter 1. Foundations for Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>, the concept of a resource de-emphasizes the differences
            between <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">physical</span>”</span> and <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">digital</span>”</span> things in favor of focusing
            on how things, in general, are used to support goal-oriented activity. Different kinds
            of books can be treated as information <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-184"><em class="firstterm">resources</em></a> regardless of the particular mix of tangible and intangible
            properties they may have. Since resource descriptions are also information resources, we
            can similarly consider how their structures support particular uses, independent of
            whether they are <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">physical,</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">digital,</span>”</span> or a mix of both.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1442" class="calibre1"></a>During World War II, a British chemist named <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">W. E.</span> <span class="calibre1">Batten</span></span> developed a system for organizing patents.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-798" href="#calibre_link-699" class="calibre1">426</a>]</sup> The system consisted of a language for describing the product, process, use,
            and apparatus of a patent, and a way of using punched cards to record these
            descriptions. Batten used cards printed with matrices of 800 positions (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-700" title="Figure 8-1. A Hollerith punched card">Figure&nbsp;8-1</a>). Each card represented a specific value from the
            vocabulary of the description language, and each position corresponded to a particular
            patent. To describe patent #256 as covering <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">extrusion of polythene to produce
                cable coverings</em></span>, one would first select the cards for the values
                <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">polythene</em></span>, <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">extrusion</em></span>, and <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">cable
                coverings</em></span>, and then punch each card at the
                256<sup class="calibre11">th</sup> position. The description of patent #256 would thus
            extend over these three cards.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-700" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2395" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000000.jpg" alt="A Hollerith punched card" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;8-1.&nbsp;A Hollerith punched card</p></div><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title8">Note</h3><p class="calibre5">Bob Glushko has questioned whether we have permission to use this image.</p></div><p class="calibre5">The advantage of this structure is that to find patents covering <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">extrusion
                of polythene</em></span> (for any purpose), one needs only to select the two cards
            corresponding to those values, lay one on top of the other, and hold them up to a light.
            Light will shine through wherever there is a position corresponding to a patent
            described using those values. Patents meeting a certain description are easily found due
            to the structure of the cards designed to describe the patents.</p><p class="calibre5">Of course, this system has clear disadvantages as well. Finding the concepts
            associated with a particular patent is tedious, because every card must be inspected.
            Adding a new patent is relatively easy as long as there is an index that allows the
            cards for specific concepts to be located quickly. However, once the cards run out of
            space for punching holes, the whole set of cards must be duplicated to accommodate more
            patents: a very expensive operation. Adding new concepts is potentially easy: simply add
            a new card. But if we want to be able to find existing patents using the new concept,
            all the existing patents would have to be re-examined to determine whether their
            positions on the new card should be punched: also an expensive operation.</p><p class="calibre5">The structure of Batten's cards supported rapid selection of <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-184"><em class="firstterm">resources</em></a> given a partial description. The
            kinds of structures we will examine in the following sections are not quite so elaborate
            as Batten's cards. But like the cards, each kind of structure supports more efficient
            mechanical execution of certain operations, at the cost of less efficient execution of
            others. </p><div class="book" title="8.2.1 Kinds of structures"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-681" class="firstname"></a>8.2.1 Kinds of structures</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Sets, lists, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are kinds of structures that can be
                used to form resource descriptions. As we shall see, each of these kinds is actually
                a family of related structures. These structures are
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">abstractions</em></span>: they describe formal structural properties in
                a general way, rather than specifying an exact physical or textual form.
                Abstractions are useful because they help us to see common properties shared by
                different specific ways of organizing information. By focusing on these common
                properties, we can more easily reason about the operations that different forms
                support and the affordances that they provide, without being distracted by less
                relevant details.</p><div class="book" title="8.2.1.1 Blobs"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2396" class="firstname"></a>8.2.1.1 Blobs</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The simplest kind of structure is no structure at all. Consider the following
                    description of a book: <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Sebald's novel uses a walking tour in East
                        Anglia to meditate on links between past and present, East and
                        West.</em></span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-799" href="#calibre_link-701" class="calibre1">427</a>]</sup> This description is an unstructured text expression with no clearly
                    defined internal parts, and we can consider it to be a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-702"><em class="firstterm">blob</em></a></strong></span>. Or, more precisely, it has structure, but that
                    structure is the underlying grammatical structure of the English language, and
                    none of that grammatical structure is explicitly represented in a surface
                    structure when the sentence is expressed. As readers of English we can interpret
                    the sentence as a description of the subject of the book, but to do this
                    mechanically is difficult.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-800" href="#calibre_link-703" class="calibre1">428</a>]</sup> On the other hand, such a written description is relatively easy to
                    create, as the describer can simply use natural language.</p><p class="calibre5">A blob need not be a blob of text. It could be a photograph of a resource, or
                    a recording of a spoken description of a resource. Like blobs of text, blobs of
                    pixels or sound have underlying structure that any person with normal vision or
                    hearing can understand easily.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-801" href="#calibre_link-704" class="calibre1">429</a>]</sup> But we can treat these blobs as unstructured, because none of the
                    underlying structure in the visual or auditory input is explicit, and we are
                    concerned with the ways that the structures of resource descriptions support or
                    inhibit mechanical or computational operations.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-802" href="#calibre_link-705" class="calibre1">430</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="8.2.1.2 Sets"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2397" class="firstname"></a>8.2.1.2 Sets</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-496" class="calibre1"></a>The simplest way to structure a description is to give it

                    Sebald's novel might be reformulated as a set of terms:

                        history</em></span>. Doing this has lost much of the meaning, but something
                    has been gained: we now can easily distinguish <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Sebald</em></span> and
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">walking</em></span> as separate items in the description.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-803" href="#calibre_link-707" class="calibre1">431</a>]</sup> This makes it easier to find, for example, all the descriptions
                    which include the term <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">walking</em></span>. (Note that this is
                    different from simply searching through blob-of-text descriptions for the word
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">walking</em></span>. When treated as a set, the description
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Fiji, fire walking, memoir</em></span> does not include the term
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">walking</em></span>, though it does include the term <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">fire
                        walking</em></span>.)</p><p class="calibre5">Sets make it easy to find intersections among descriptions. Sets are also easy

                    users create resource descriptions. In these systems, descriptions are
                    structured as sets of <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">tags.</span>”</span> To find resources, users can specify
                    a set of tags to obtain resources having descriptions that intersect at those
                    tags. This is more valuable if the tags come from a <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-99"><em class="firstterm">controlled vocabulary</em></a>,
                    making intersections more likely. But enforcing vocabulary control adds
                    complexity to the description process, so a balance must be struck between
                    maximizing potential intersections and making description as simple as
                        practical.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-804" href="#calibre_link-709" class="calibre1">432</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-342" class="calibre1"></a>A set is a type or class of structure. We can

                        fixed-size set. We can also remove constraints. Sets do not contain
                        duplicate items (think of a tagging system in which it does not make sense
                        to assign the same tag more than once to the same resource). If we remove

                        constraint, we have a different structure known as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">bag</span>”</span> or

                    in which it was important that the order of the tags be maintained, we would
                    want to use lists, not sets. Unlike sets, lists may contain duplicate items. In
                    a list, two items that are otherwise the same can be distinguished by their
                    position in the ordering, but in a set this is not possible. For example, we
                    might want to organize the tags assigned to a resource, listing the most used
                    tag first, the least frequently used last, and the rest ordered according their
                    according to their frequency of use.</p><p class="calibre5">Again, we can introduce constraints to refine the definition of different
                    kinds of lists such as fixed-length lists. If we constrain a list to contain
                    only items that are themselves lists, and further specify that these contained
                    lists do not themselves contains lists, then we have a
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">table</em></span> (a list of lists of items). A spreadsheet is a

                    individually addressed, there is no way to distinguish the items except by
                    comparing their values (or, in a list, their positions in the ordering). In a
                    set of tags like <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Sebald</em></span>, <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">novel, East Anglia,
                        walking, history</em></span>, for example, one cannot easily tell that
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Sebald</em></span> refers to the author of the book while
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">East Anglia</em></span> and <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">walking</em></span> refer to
                    what it is about. One-way of addressing this problem is to break each item in a
                    set into two parts: a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-307"><em class="firstterm">property</em></a></strong></span> and a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-513"><em class="firstterm">value</em></a></strong></span>.
                    So, for example, our simple set of tags might become <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">author: Sebald,

                        easily find the value (such as a definition) associated with a particular
                        property or <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">key</em></span> (such as a word). But unlike a real
                        dictionary, which orders its keys alphabetically, a dictionary structure
                        does not specify an order for its keys.</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-806" href="#calibre_link-716" class="calibre1">434</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Dictionaries are found everywhere in resource descriptions. Structured
                    descriptions entered using a form are easily represented as dictionaries, where

                    values. Tabular data with a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">header row</span>”</span> can be thought of as a set
                    of dictionaries, where the column headers are the properties for each
                    dictionary, and each row is a set of corresponding values. Dictionaries are also
                    a basic type of data structure found in nearly all programming languages (where

                    dictionaries. A sorted dictionary adds an ordering over entries; in other words,

                    nodes below (to the right of) it in the tree. A node is referred to as the

                    addition of an ordering constraint distinguishes <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> trees from
                    nested dictionaries, in which child nodes do not have any order (because
                    dictionary entries do not have an ordering). Ordering is an important constraint
                    for resource descriptions, since without ordering it is impossible to (for
                    example) list multiple authors while guaranteeing that the order of authors will

                    property and a value. Trees exist in a large variety of flavors, but they all
                    share a common topology: the edges between nodes are directed (one node is the

                    Making the author the primary or root resource allows us to include multiple

                    as long as we can clearly identity a primary resource. In some cases, however,
                    we want to connect descriptions of related resources without having to designate

                    two books, but that relationship is not explicitly represented in the structure:
                    we just have two separate dictionaries and have inferred the relationship by
                    matching property values. It is possible that this inference could be wrong:
                    there might be two people named <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Winfried Georg Sebald</em></span>. How
                    can we structure these descriptions to explicitly represent the fact that the
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Winfried Georg Sebald</em></span> that is the subject of the first
                    book is the same <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Winfried Georg Sebald</em></span> who authored the
                    second?</p><p class="calibre5">One possibility would be to make <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Winfried Georg Sebald</em></span>
                    the root of a tree, similar to the approach taken in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-724" title="Example 8-3. Example 3. Nesting book descriptions within an author description.">Example&nbsp;8-3</a>, adding a <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">book about</em></span>
                    property alongside the <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">books authored</em></span> one. This solution
                    would work fine if we felt that people were our primary resources, and it thus
                    made sense to structure our descriptions around them. But suppose that we had
                    decided that our descriptions should be structured around books, and that we
                    were using a vocabulary that took this perspective (with properties such as
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">author</em></span> and <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">subject</em></span> rather than

                    We should not let a particular structure limit the organizational perspective we
                    can take, as Batten's cards did. Instead, we should consciously choose
                    structures to suit our organizational perspective. How can we do this?</p><p class="calibre5">If we treat our two book descriptions as trees, we can join the two branches
                    (subject and author) that share a value. When we do this, we no longer have a
                    tree, because we now have a node with more than one parent (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-726" title="Figure 8-4. Descriptions linked into a graph">Figure&nbsp;8-4</a>). The structure in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-726" title="Figure 8-4. Descriptions linked into a graph">Figure&nbsp;8-4</a> is a <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-727"><em class="firstterm">graph</em></a></strong></span>.
                        <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-394" class="calibre1"></a>Like a <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-364"><em class="firstterm">tree</em></a>, a <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-727"><em class="firstterm">graph</em></a> consists of a set of nodes connected by edges. These
                        edges may or may not have a direction (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-728" title="5.6.3 Directionality">5.6.3 Directionality</a>). If
                        they do, the graph is referred to as a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">directed graph</span>”</span>. If a
                        graph is directed, it may be possible to start at a node and follow edges in
                        a path that leads back to the starting node. Such a path is called a
                            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">cycle</span>”</span>. If a directed graph has no cycles, it is referred
                        to as an <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">acyclic graph</span>”</span>.</span></p><p class="calibre5">A tree is just a more constrained kind of graph. Trees are
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">directed</em></span> graphs because the <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">parent of</span>”</span>
                    relationship between nodes is asymmetric: the edges are arrows that point in a
                    certain direction (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-729" title="5.3.2.1 Symmetry">5.3.2.1 Symmetry</a>). Furthermore, trees
                    are <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">acyclic</em></span> graphs, because if you follow the directed
                    edges from one node to another, you can never encounter the same node twice.
                    Finally, trees have the constraint that every node (except the root) must have
                    exactly one parent.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-809" href="#calibre_link-730" class="calibre1">437</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">In <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-726" title="Figure 8-4. Descriptions linked into a graph">Figure&nbsp;8-4</a>, we have violated this constraint by
                    joining our two book trees. The graph that results is still directed and
                    acyclic, but because the <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Winfried George Sebald</em></span> node now
                    has two parents, it is no longer a tree.</p><p class="calibre5">Graphs are very general and flexible structures. Many kinds of systems can be
                    conceived of as nodes connected by edges: stations connected by subway lines,
                    people connected by friendships, decisions connected by dependencies, and so on.
                    Relationships can be modeled in different ways using different kinds of graphs.
                    For example, if we assume that friendship is symmetric (see <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-729" title="5.3.2.1 Symmetry">5.3.2.1 Symmetry</a>), we would use an undirected graph to model the
                    relationship. However, in web-based social networks friendship is often
                    asymmetric (you might <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">friend</span>”</span> someone who does not reciprocate),
                    so a directed graph is more appropriate.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-726" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2409" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000026.jpg" alt="Descriptions linked into a graph" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;8-4.&nbsp;Descriptions linked into a graph</p></div><p class="calibre5">Often it is useful to treat a graph as a set of pairs of nodes, where each

                    and then analyzing patterns of connectedness among them. As we will see, being
                    able to break down a graph into pairs is also useful when we structure resource
                    descriptions as graphs.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="8.2.2 Comparing metamodels: JSON, XML and RDF"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-682" class="firstname"></a>8.2.2 Comparing metamodels: JSON, XML and RDF</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Now that we are familiar with the various <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">kinds</em></span> of metamodels

                                    Specifically, the <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> metamodel consists of
                                    two kinds of structures found in JavaScript: lists (called
                                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">arrays</em></span> in JavaScript) and dictionaries
                                    (called <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">objects</em></span> in JavaScript). Lists and
                                    dictionaries contain values, which may be strings of text,
                                    numbers, Booleans (true or false), or the null (empty) value.
                                    Again, these types of values are taken directly from JavaScript.
                                    Lists and dictionaries can be values too, meaning lists and
                                    dictionaries can be nested within one another to produce more
                                    complex structures such as tables and trees. </span>
                            </p></dd></dl></div><p class="calibre5">Lists, dictionaries, and a basic set of value types constitute the
                        <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> metamodel. Because this metamodel is a subset of
                    JavaScript, the <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> metamodel is very easy to work with in
                    JavaScript. Since JavaScript is the only programming language that is available
                    in all Web browsers, <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> has become a popular choice for
                    developers who need to work with data and resource descriptions on the Web (see

                    modern programming languages provide data structures and value types equivalent
                    to those provided by JavaScript. So, data represented as <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>
                    is easy to work with in many programming languages, not just JavaScript.</p><div class="figure"><a id="calibre_link-736" class="calibre1"></a><div class="book"><div class="book"><a id="calibre_link-2410" class="calibre1"></a><img src="images/000022.jpg" alt="A description structure conforming to the XML Infoset metamodel" class="calibre12"></img></div></div><p class="title5">Figure&nbsp;8-5.&nbsp;A description structure conforming to the XML Infoset

                        one simply declares the entity and its corresponding value, which could be
                        anything from an entire document to a phrase and then it may be referenced

                organized. For example, when designing a system for organizing books, we do not want

                because the <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> metamodel constrains structure and not the content
                of descriptions. We need also to specify that a book description includes a list of
                contributors, each entry of which provides a name and indicates the role of that
                contributor. This kind of specification is a <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">model</em></span> to which our

                    descriptions without worrying about checking structure at the document level.
                    However, sometimes it is desirable to check descriptions at the document level,

                    the terms that can be used for property names and the terms that can be used for
                    property values. For example, an <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> schema may enumerate a

                    for use as property values in resource descriptions. Typically these
                    vocabularies provide values for use within statements that describe what a

Examples of such subject vocabularies include the <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Library of Congress Subject Headings</span>(LCSH)</span> and the <em class="firstterm"><a id="calibre_link-1715" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Medical Subject Headings</span>(MeSH)</span></em>. Other vocabularies (naming authorities) may
                    provide preferred names for people, corporations, or places. Classification
                    schemes are yet another kind of vocabulary, providing values for use in

                    assigned to properties. Another strategy is to specify what <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">types</span>”</span> of values can be assigned. For example, a model for book
                    descriptions may specify that the value of a <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">pages</em></span> property
                    must be a positive integer. Or it could be more specific; a course catalog might
                    give each course an identifier that contains a two-letter department code
                    followed by a 1-3 digit course number. Specifying a data type like this with a
                    regular expression narrows down the set of possible values for the property
                    without having to enumerate every possible value.</p><p class="calibre5">In addition to or in lieu of specifying a type, a model may specify an

                        1976</code>, <code class="literal">September 2nd 1976</code>, etc. So, Atom also
                    specifies an encoding scheme for date values. The encoding scheme is <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">RFC3339</span></span>, a standard for writing dates. When using <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">RFC3339</span></span>, one always writes a date using the same form:

                    how they fit or do not fit the ways we want to model our resource descriptions
                    can help us select a specific metamodel. Specific metamodels such as the

                codified and standardized for use in a digital environment. A traditional notation
                like the Latin alphabet can withstand a certain degree of variation in the form of a
                particular mark. You and I might write the letter <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">A</em></span> rather
                differently, but as long as we can mutually recognize each other's marks as an
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">A</span>”</span>, we can successfully share a notation. Computers, however,
                cannot easily accommodate such variation. Each character must be strictly defined.
                In the case of <abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr>, each character is given a number from 0 to
                127, so that there are 128 <abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr>

                6.0 assigns numbers to 109,449 characters.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-831" href="#calibre_link-773" class="calibre1">458</a>]</sup>
                <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-326" class="calibre1"></a>Unicode makes the important distinction between <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><em class="firstterm">characters</em></strong></span> and <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-774"><em class="firstterm">glyphs</em></a></strong></span>. A character is the
                    smallest meaningful unit of a written language. In alphabet-based languages like
                    English, characters are letters; in languages like Chinese, characters are
                    ideographs.</span> Unicode treats all of these characters as abstract ideas
                    (<span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Latin capital A</em></span>) rather than specific marks (A À Ä).
                    <span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-390" class="calibre1"></a>A specific mark that can be used to depict a character is

                    used to depict some set of characters. A Unicode font explicitly associates each
                    glyph with a particular number in the Unicode character encoding.</span> The
                inability of computers to use contextual understanding to bridge the gap between
                various glyphs and the abstract character depicted by those glyphs turns out to have
                important consequences for <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                    systems</em></a>.</p><p class="calibre5">Different notations may include very similar marks. For example, modern music
                notation includes marks for indicating the pitch of note, known as accidentals. One
                of these music notation marks is <span class="calibre1">♯</span> (<span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">sharp</span>”</span>).
                The sharp sign looks very much like the symbol used in English as an abbreviation
                for the word <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">number</em></span>, as in
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">We<span class="calibre1">’</span>re #1!</em></span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-832" href="#calibre_link-775" class="calibre1">459</a>]</sup> If you were to write a sharp sign and a number sign by hand, they would
                probably look identical. In a non-digital environment, we would rely on context to
                understand whether the written mark was being used as part of music notation, or
                mathematical notation, or as an English abbreviation.</p><p class="calibre5">Computers, however, have no such intuitive understanding of context. Unicode
                encodes the number sign and the sharp sign as two different characters. As far as a
                computer using Unicode is concerned, <span class="calibre1">♯</span> and # are completely
                different, and the fact that they have similar-looking glyphs is irrelevant. That is
                a problem if, for example, a cataloger has carefully described a piece of music by
                correctly using the sharp sign, but a person looking for that piece of music
                searches for descriptions using the number sign (since that is what you get when you
                press the keyboard button with the symbol that most closely resembles a sharp
                    sign).<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-833" href="#calibre_link-776" class="calibre1">460</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="book" title="8.3.2 Writing systems"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-686" class="firstname"></a>8.3.2 Writing systems</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-520" class="calibre1"></a>A <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2425" href="#calibre_link-603"><em class="firstterm">writing system</em></a></strong></span> employs
                    one or more notations, and adds a set of rules for using them. Most writing
                    systems assume knowledge of a particular human language. These writing systems
                    are known as <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">glottic</em></span> writing systems. But there are many
                    writing systems, such as mathematical and musical ones, that are not tied to
                    human languages in this way. Many of the writing systems used for describing
                    resources belong to this latter group, meaning that (at least in principle) they
                    can be used with equal facility by speakers of any language.</span></p><p class="calibre5">Glottic writing systems, being grounded in natural human languages, are difficult
                to describe precisely and comprehensively. Non-glottic writing systems, on the other
                hand, can be described precisely and comprehensively using an abstract model. That
                is the connection between the structural perspective taken in the previous section,
                and the textual perspective taken in this section. A non-glottic writing system is
                described by a particular metamodel, and structures that fit within the constraints
                of a given metamodel can be textually represented using one or more writing systems
                that are described by that metamodel.</p><p class="calibre5">Some writing systems are closely identified with specific metamodels. For example,
                    <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> and <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> are <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">both</em></span> 1)
                metamodels for structuring information <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">and</em></span> 2) writing systems
                for textually representing information. In other words, they specify both the
                abstract structure of a description and how to write it down. It is possible to
                conceive of other ways to textually represent the structure of these metamodels, but
                for each of these metamodels just one writing system has been standardized.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-834" href="#calibre_link-777" class="calibre1">461</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr>, on the other hand, is <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">only</em></span> a metamodel,
                not a writing system. <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr> only defines an abstract structure, not
                how to write that structure. So how do we write information that is structured as
                RDF? It turns out that we have many choices. Unlike <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> and
                    <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>, several different writing systems for the
                    <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr> metamodel have been standardized, including N-Triples,
                Turtle, RDFa, and RDF/XML.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-835" href="#calibre_link-778" class="calibre1">462</a>]</sup> Each of these is a writing system that is abstractly described by the
                    <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr> metamodel.</p><p class="calibre5">Writing systems provide rules for arranging characters from a notation into
                meaningful structures. A character in a notation has no inherent meaning. Characters
                in a notation only take on meaning in the context of a writing system that uses that
                notation. For example: what does the letter <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">I</span></em></span>
                from the Latin alphabet mean? That question can only be answered by looking at how
                it is being used in a particular writing system. If the writing system is American
                English, then whether <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">I</span></em></span> has a meaning depends
                on whether it is grouped with other letters or whether it stands alone. Only in the
                latter case does it have an assignable meaning. However in the arithmetic writing
                system of Ancient Rome, which also uses as a notation the letters of the Latin
                alphabet, <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">I</span></em></span> has a different meaning:
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">one</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">This example also serves to illustrate how the ordering of a notation can differ
                from the ordering of a writing system that uses that notation. According to the
                ordering of the Latin alphabet, the twelfth letter
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">L</span></em></span> comes before the twenty-second letter
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">V</span></em></span>. But in the Roman numeric writing
                system, <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">V</span></em></span> (the number 5) comes before
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">L</span></em></span> (the number 50). Unless we know
                which ordering we are using, we cannot arrange
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">L</span></em></span> and
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">V</span></em></span>
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">in order.</span>”</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-836" href="#calibre_link-779" class="calibre1">463</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">This kind of difference in ordering can arise in more subtle ways as well. When we
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">alphabetically</span>”</span> order names, we first compare the first character
                of each name, and arrange them according to the ordering of the writing
                    system.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-837" href="#calibre_link-780" class="calibre1">464</a>]</sup> If the first characters of two names are the same, we compare the second
                character, and so on. We can also apply this same kind of ordering procedure to
                sequences of numerals. If we do, then <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">334</em></span> will come before
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">67</em></span>, because <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">3</em></span> (the first character of
                the first sequence) comes before <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">6</em></span> (the first character of the
                second sequence) according to the ordering of our notation (Arabic numerals).
                However, it is more common when ordering sequences of numerals to treat them as
                decimal numbers, and thus to use the ordering imposed by the decimal system. In the
                decimal writing system, <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">67</em></span> precedes <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">334</em></span>,
                since the latter is a bigger</p><p class="calibre5">This difference is important for organizing systems. Computers will sort values
                differently depending on whether they are treating sequences of numerals as numbers
                or just as sequences. Some organizing systems mix multiple ways of ordering the same
                characters. For example, <span class="calibre1">Library of Congress</span> call numbers have
                four parts, and sequences of Arabic numerals can appear in three of them. In the
                second part, indicating a narrow subject area, and fourth part, indicating year of
                publication, sequences of numerals are treated as numbers and ordered according to
                the decimal system. In the third part, however, sequences of numerals are treated as
                sequences and ordered <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">notationally</span>”</span> as in the example above
                    (<span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">334</em></span> before <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">67</em></span>).</p><p class="calibre5">Differences in ordering demonstrate just one way that multiple writing systems may
                use the same notation differently. For example, the American English and British
                English writing systems both use the same Latin alphabet, but impose slightly
                different spelling rules.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-838" href="#calibre_link-781" class="calibre1">465</a>]</sup> The Japanese writing system employs a number of notations, including
                traditional Chinese characters (<span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">kanji</em></span>) as well as the Latin
                alphabet (<span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">rōmaji</em></span>). Often writing systems do not share the
                same exact notation but have mostly overlapping notations. Many European languages,
                for example, extend the Latin alphabet with characters such as
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">Å</span></em></span> and
                        <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm"><span class="calibre1">Ü</span></em></span> that add additional marks,
                known as diacritics, to the basic characters.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-839" href="#calibre_link-782" class="calibre1">466</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Often in <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                    systems</em></a>, it is necessary to represent values from one writing system
                in another writing system that uses a different notation, a process known as
                    <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">transliteration</strong></span>. For example, early computer
                systems only supported the <abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr> notation, so text from writing
                systems that extend the Latin alphabet had to be converted to
                <abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr>, usually by removing (or sometimes transliterating)
                diacritics. This made the non-<abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr> text usable in an <abbr class="calibre1">ASCII</abbr>-based computerized organizing system, at the
                expense of information loss.</p><p class="calibre5">Even in modern computer systems that support Unicode, however, transliteration is
                often needed to support organizing activities by users who cannot read text written
                using its original system. The <span class="calibre1">Library of Congress</span> and the
                    <span class="calibre1">American Library Association</span> provide standard procedures for
                transliterating text from over sixty different writing systems into the (extended)

                combined into words and how words can be combined into higher-level
                    structures.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-840" href="#calibre_link-784" class="calibre1">467</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">Consider the first example: <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">The title is</em></span> Die Ringe des Saturn
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">and it has 371 pages</em></span>. The leading capital letter and the
                period ending this sequence of characters indicate to us that this is a sentence.
                This sentence is one way we might use the English writing system to express two
                statements about the book we are describing. A <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">statement</em></span> is one
                distinct fact or piece of information. In glottic writing systems like English,
                there is usually more than one sentence we could write to express the same
                statement. For example, instead of <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">it has 371 pages</em></span> we might
                have written <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">the number of pages is 371</em></span>. English writing also
                enables us to construct complex sentences that express more than one
                    statement.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-841" href="#calibre_link-785" class="calibre1">468</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5">In contrast, when we create descriptions of resources in an organizing system, we
                generally use non-glottic writing systems in which each sentence only expresses a
                single statement, and there is just one way to write a sentence that expresses a
                given statement.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-842" href="#calibre_link-786" class="calibre1">469</a>]</sup> These restrictions make these writing systems less expressive, but
                simplify their use. In particular, since there is a one-to-one correspondence
                between sentences and statements, we can drop the distinction and just talk about
                the statements of a description.</p><p class="calibre5">Now we return to our example and look at the structure of the statement,
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">The title is</em></span> Die Ringe des Saturn <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">and it has 371
                    pages</em></span>. Spaces are used to separate the text into words, and English
                syntax defines the functions of those words. The verb <span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9">is</strong></span> in this statement functions to link the word title to the phrase
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Die Ringe des Saturn</em></span>. This is typical of the kind of
                statements found in a resource description. Each statement identifies and describes
                some aspect of the resource. In this case, the statement attributes the value
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">Die Ringe des Saturn</em></span> to the property
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">title</em></span>.</p><p class="calibre5">As we saw when we looked at description structures, we can analyze descriptions as
                involving properties of resources and their corresponding values or content. In a
                writing system like English, it is not always so straightforward to determine which
                words refer to properties and which refer to values. (This is why blobs are not
                ideal description structures.) Writing systems designed for expressing resource
                descriptions, on the other hand, usually define syntax that makes this determination
                easier. In our dictionary examples above, we used an arrow character
                    <span class="calibre1">→</span> to indicate the relationship between properties and
                values.</p><p class="calibre5">This ease of distinguishing properties and values comes at a price, however. The
                syntax of English is forgiving: we can read a sentence with somewhat garbled syntax
                such as <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">371 pages it has</em></span> and often still make out its
                    meaning.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-843" href="#calibre_link-787" class="calibre1">470</a>]</sup> This is usually not the case with writing systems intended for
                expressing resource descriptions. These systems strictly define their rules for how
                characters can be combined into higher-level structures. Structures that follow the
                rules are <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">well formed</em></span> according to that system.</p><p class="calibre5">Take for example the second entry in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-765" title="Table 8-1. Table 8-1: Basic ways of writing part of a book description.">Table&nbsp;8-1</a>. This
                example is written in <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>. As explained earlier in this chapter,
                    <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> is a metamodel for structuring information using lists and
                dictionaries. But <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> is also a writing system, which borrows its
                syntax from JavaScript. The <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr> syntax uses brackets to textually
                represent lists <code class="literal">[1,2,3]</code> and braces to textually represent
                dictionaries <code class="literal">{title:"Die Ringe des Saturn", "pages":371}</code>. Within
                braces, the colon character <code class="literal">:</code> is used to link properties with
                their values, much as is was used in the previous example. So
                    <code class="literal">"pages":371</code> is a statement assigning the value
                    <code class="literal">371</code> to the property <code class="literal">pages</code>.</p><p class="calibre5">The third example in Table 8-1 is written in <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>. Like
                    <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>, <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> is a metamodel and also a writing
                system. Here we have <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> elements and attributes.
                    <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> elements are textually represented as
                    <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">tags</em></span> that are marked using the special characters
                    <code class="literal">&lt;</code>, <code class="literal">&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">/</code>. So,
                this fragment of <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> consists of a <code class="literal">book</code> element
                with a child element, <code class="literal">title</code> and a <code class="literal">pages</code>
                attribute each of which has some text content. In this case,
                    <code class="literal">pages="371"</code> is a statement assigning the value 371 to the
                property <code class="literal">pages</code>. The difference is syntax is subtle; quotation
                marks surround the value and equal sign = is used to assign the property to its
                value.</p><p class="calibre5">The fourth example is a fragment of <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr>. The writing system that
                    <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr> employs is close enough to <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> to ignore
                any differences in syntax. In this example, the CLASS attribute... </p><p class="calibre5">The fifth example in Table 1 is a fragment of Turtle, one of the writing systems
                for <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr>. Turtle provides a syntax for writing down
                    <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr>
                <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-748"><em class="firstterm">triples</em></a>. Each triple consists of a
                subject, predicate, and object separated by spaces. Recall that <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr>
                uses <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr>s to identify subjects, predicates, and some objects; these
                    <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr>s are written in Turtle by enclosing them in angle brackets
                    <code class="literal">&lt; &gt;</code>. Triples are separated by period
                    <code class="literal">.</code> characters, but triples that share the same subject can be
                written more compactly by writing the subject only once, and then writing the
                predicate and object of each triple, separated by a semicolon <code class="literal">;</code>
                character. This is what we see in Table 1: two triples that share a subject.</p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1549" class="calibre1"></a>The two examples in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-788" title="Table 8-2. Table 8-2: Writing part of a book description in Semantic XML.">Table&nbsp;8-2</a> demonstrate

                semantic encoding of description resources. The first example extends the third
                example from Table 1; the
                    <code class="literal">xmlns:dc="<em class="replaceable"><code class="replaceable">...</code></em>"</code> segment is a
                namespace declaration which is associating <code class="literal">dc</code> with the quoted
                URI, which happens to be the <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</span>(DCMI)</span>; the child <code class="literal">&lt;dc:title&gt;</code> element and
                the attached <code class="literal">dc:extent="371"</code> tell us that the corresponding
                values are attributable to the title and extent properties, respectively, from the
                Dublin Core namespace. The next example employs DocBook DTD namespace; we now have a

            particular structures, and as written documents with particular syntaxes. As we have
            seen, there are many possible choices of structure and syntax. But these choices are
            never made in isolation. Just as an architect or designer must work within the
            constraints of the existing built environment, and just as any author must work with
            existing writing systems, descriptions are always created as part of a pre-existing
                <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">world</span>”</span> over which any one of us has little control.</p><p class="calibre5">In the final part of this chapter, we will consider how choices of structure and
            syntax have converged historically into broad patterns of usage. For lack of a better
            term, we call these broad patterns <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">worlds.</span>”</span>
            <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">World</span>”</span> is not a technical term and should not be taken too literally: the
            broad areas of application sketched here have considerable overlap, and there are many
            other ways one might identify patterns of description structure and syntax. That said,
            the three <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">worlds</span>”</span> described here do reflect real patterns of description
            form that influence tool and technology choices. In your own work creating and managing
            resource descriptions, it is likely that you will need to think about how your
            descriptions fit into one or more of these worlds.</p><div class="book" title="8.4.1 The Document Processing World"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-689" class="firstname"></a>8.4.1 The Document Processing World</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">The first world we will consider is concerned primarily with the creation,

                all contain a mixture of narrative text and structured data, and they all can be
                usefully modeled as tree structures. Because of these shared qualities, tools as
                different as publishing software, supply-chain management software, and scholarly
                editing software have all converged on common <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>-based solutions.

                    using the <code class="literal">&lt;A&gt;</code> element. Each of these elements
                    had four attributes in common: the famous HREF attribute contains a URI that
                    names an object resource; the NAME attribute allowed the element to be the
                    target end of a link, and; the REL and REV attributes contains descriptions of
                    the link relations. Microformats, RDFa and Microdata are the latest generation
                    of metadata extensions to HTML. Each approach is widely used on the web and by
                    search engines. As such, they are potential targets when transforming into HTML
                    from richer semantic formats. </p><p class="calibre5">Microformats are the simplest of the three. It uses controlled vocabularies of
                    terms in REL/REV, and in the CLASS attribute, to declare high-level information
                    types. </p><p class="calibre5">RDFa is RDF in Attributes. That is, RDFa is a formal specification for writing
                    RDF expressions by using attributes in <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr> and
                        <abbr class="calibre1">HTML</abbr> documents. It uses an ABOUT attribute to name the
                    subject of the relation; the REL and REV attributes; HREF is joined by SRC and
                    RESOURCE to name the object of the link, and; PROPERTY and CONTENT attributes
                    are used to <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-512"><em class="firstterm">attribute</em></a> a value
                    to an object's property.</p><p class="calibre5">Microdata is similar, inasmuch as it uses attributes extensively. The presence
                    of an ITEMSCOPE attribute identifies an item while the ITEMTYPE attribute value
                    identifies its type; ITEMID declares an items name or unique identifier;
                    ITEMPROP is a name value pair, and; ITEMREF relates this item to other elements

                for programming the Web. In the programming languages used to implement Web
                services, <abbr class="calibre1">HTTP</abbr> headers and query parameters are easily mapped to
                dictionary data structures native to those languages. On the client side, there is
                only one programming language that runs within all Web browsers: <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">JavaScript</span></span>. The dictionary is the fundamental data structure within JavaScript
                as well.</p><p class="calibre5">Thus it is unsurprising that <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>, a dictionary-structured,
                JavaScript-based syntax, has become the de facto standard for
                application-to-application interchange of data on the web in contexts that do not
                involve business transactions. Web services providing structured data intended for
                programmatic use can make that data available as <abbr class="calibre1">JSON</abbr>, which is
                well-suited for use either by JavaScript programs running within browsers, or by
                programs written in other languages running outside of browsers (for example, smart

                types are <abbr class="calibre1">XML</abbr>-based, such as the Atom syndication format. Trees
                will continue to be the structure of choice for Web representations that consist
                primarily of narrative rather than transactional data. But for structured

                    Web world, but adds some further prescriptions and constraints for how to
                    structure descriptions. The Semantic Web world unifies the concept of a resource

                    one another via their <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr>s. Advocates of Linked Data further
                    prescribe that those descriptions must be made available as representations
                    transferred over <abbr class="calibre1">HTTP</abbr>.</span><sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-848" href="#calibre_link-795" class="calibre1">475</a>]</sup></p><p class="calibre5"><a id="calibre_link-1863" class="calibre1"></a>This is a departure from the Web world. The Web world is also structured

                Web world, in addition to the list having a URIs, each book would have a
                    <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr> too, in addition to whatever other identifiers it might

                Data are being followed. This, too, is a departure from the Web world, which is
                agnostic about the form representations or descriptions of <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-184"><em class="firstterm">resources</em></a> should take (although as we have
                seen, dictionary structures are often favored on the Web when the clients consuming

                structured as <abbr class="calibre1">RDF</abbr> graphs. Each description graph links to other
                description graphs by referring to these related resources using their
                    <abbr class="calibre1">URI</abbr>s. Thus, at least in theory, all description graphs on the

            attention on the third main activity we outlined in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-27" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>:
            designing resource-based interactions. What kinds of interactions do we encounter and
            what interactions are needed in <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                systems</em></a>?</p><p class="calibre5">The interactions with resources to select, describe, and organize them were discussed
            in <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-27" title="Chapter 2. Activities in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>, <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29" title="Chapter 4. Resource Description and Metadata">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>, and <a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30" title="Chapter 6. Categorization: Describing Resource Classes and Types">Chapter&nbsp;6</a> and we do not need to consider them again in this chapter.
            Furthermore, while it is crucial to understand all interactions that are possible within
            an organizing system context, this chapter will concentrate on interactions that are
            purposefully designed into them rather than those that arise naturally from the
            affordances of the resources (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-31" title="2.4.1 Affordance and Capability">2.4.1 Affordance and Capability</a>).</p><p class="calibre5">Designed interactions necessitate a careful analysis of requirements and resource
            properties to be implemented. More interactions might make a system more capable, but
            not always, and they might make it more complicated to maintain. For example, if a
            library provides an access interaction for users by giving them direct access to the
            stacks, it is not necessary to provide personnel to retrieve the books for users, but
            books might get lost or misplaced. In other words, it may be better to aim for as many
            interactions as practical, rather than aiming for as many as possible.</p><p class="calibre5">Initially, we will look at several organizing system environments and some of their
            main designed interactions. Although resources and their descriptions might be
            different, it turns out that similar interactions occur in every organizing system
                <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> albeit in different implementations.</p><div class="book" title="9.1.1 Interactions in Libraries"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-6" class="firstname"></a>9.1.1 Interactions in Libraries</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">The main interaction supported by most libraries is
                        <span class="calibre1">borrowing</span>.</span> Library resources are checked out by
                their users, i.e. books are accessed and taken from the library by patrons.
                Libraries buy and describe books so that they can be found by patrons and borrowed.
                When you need to find a book on a certain topic or by a certain author or title, you
                access the resource descriptions in the library catalog to search for resources that
                satisfy your requirement, then you access the resource directly, or ask a librarian
                to retrieve the resource for you when it can be made available in your physical
                location. A <span class="calibre1">check-out</span> interaction leaves a record of the resource
                identifier, the borrower identifier, and the <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-32"><em class="firstterm">effectivity</em></a> dates of the loan.</p><p class="calibre5">Library catalogs offer a <span class="calibre1">search</span> interaction to enable queries
                about particular fields in resource descriptions like <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">author</span>”</span> or
                    <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">title.</span>”</span> Finding a description record for a book in a library
                catalog usually means that the book is owned by the library and, therefore, that it
                could be borrowed, or checked out.</p><p class="calibre5">A much more powerful search interaction is enabled by a union catalog (e.g.
                    <span class="calibre1">OCLC</span>'s <span class="calibre1">Worldcat</span>, where resource
                descriptions from multiple libraries are merged before they are offered for search.
                Patrons will go through to two search steps: the first is to find the resource
                description in the union catalog, and the second is to find whether the book is
                available in their local library, and if not, then where might one have to go to be
                able to have access to that particular resource, such as a special edition of a
                manuscript that is in storage at the US <span class="calibre1">Library of Congress</span> and
                is only available for private exhibition by appointment and with good

                with access to discover or experience resources by <span class="calibre1"><em class="firstterm">exhibiting</em></span>
                artifacts in creative contexts. When museums implement this interaction in a web
                site, visitors are not only able to discover what is presented to them by the museum
                curators but also can interact with resources in new ways. Virtual collections
                enable patrons who are unable to visit remote museums to search and view their
                resources. Patrons who intend to visit museums can direct their searches to locate
                resources that may not be currently on view.</p><p class="calibre5">The digitization of museum resources allows visitors to experience them from a
                perspective that might not even be possible in a physical museum, for example the

                implementation challenges as producers often use different identifiers, descriptions
                or cataloging formats and practices for similar resources. Different service
                providers use different technologies, have different information policies and
                different processes developed in their organizing systems. Some partners can exert
                power and determine description standards (e.g. <span class="calibre1">Walmart</span>); others
                have to adapt to whatever their counterparts develop (e.g.

            balance between the resources, the organizing system that arranges and manages them, its
            producers and its intended users or consumers. The design of interactions is driven by
            user requirements and their impact on the choices made in the implementation process. It
            is constrained by resource and technical system properties and by social and legal
            requirements. Determining the scope and scale of interactions needs a careful analysis
            of these individual factors, their combination, and the consequences thereof. It is
            useful to distinguish decisions that involve choices, where multiple feasible
            alternatives exist, from decisions that involve constraints, where design choices have
            been eliminated or rendered infeasible by previous ones. For both types of resources the
            goal when creating an organizing system is to make design decisions that preserve

                With a business or institutional organizing system the user needs to describe the

                required. User information needs are most often expressed in search queries
                (whatever is typed into a search box) or manifest themselves in the selection of the
                system categories that are offered for browsing. Queries can be as simple as a few
                key words or may be very complex and specialized by employing different search
                fields or operators or even expressed in a query language by expert users.

                browsing an organizing system's category system. Some systems allow the query to be
                expressed in natural language and then transform it into a description that is
                easier for the system to process. Queries for non-textual information like photos or
                videos are typically also expressed as text, but some systems compute descriptions
                from non-textual queries like images or audio files. For example, a user can hum a
                tune and the system will <span class="calibre1">transform</span> it to locate the desired audio

                systems increasingly attempt to solicit the user's context or larger work task in
                order to provide more suitable or precise interactions. The level of education,
                physical disabilities, location, time, deadline pressure etc., further specify and
                constrain the types of resources needed as well as the types of interactions the
                user is willing or capable to engage in. Using mostly implicit information collected
                from user behavior, for example a search or buying history, current user location or
                language and social or collaborative behavior (other people with the same context),
                interactions are targeted toward individual user situations. Information needs of
                computational agents are determined by rules and criteria set by the creators of the
                agents, i.e. the function or goal of the agent.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">Organizing systems should plan for interactions based on non-purposeful
                    user behavior.</span>
                <span class="calibre1">A user who does not have a particular resource need in mind might interact
                    with an organizing system to see what it contains or to be entertained or
                    educated.</span> Imagine a user going to a museum to avoid the heat outside.
                Their requirement is to be out of the heat and <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> possibly
                    <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> to see interesting things. A visitor to a zoo might go
                there to view a specific animal, but most of the time, visitors follow a more or
                less random path along the zoo's resources. Similarly, <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">web surfing</span>”</span> is
                random, non-information-need driven behavior. This type of requirement cannot be
                satisfied by providing search capabilities alone (state an information need) but
                needs to provide other interaction types (e.g. browsing, suggestions) as
                well.</p><p class="calibre5">Lastly, not all users are human beings, <span class="calibre1">typing in search queries</span>
                or <span class="calibre1">browsing through catalogs</span>. An organizing system should plan for
                interaction scenarios where computational agents access the system via <abbr class="calibre1">API</abbr>s (<span class="calibre1">application programming

                an individual resource can support depend on the nature and extent of its inherent
                and described properties and internal structure. However, the interactions that can
                be designed into an organizing system can be extended by utilizing collection
                properties, computed or derived properties and any combination thereof. These three

                enabled and more interactions can be designed. In a sense, the degree of possible
                interactions is determined by the extent of the properties that are organized,
                described and created in an organizing system. This marks a correlation between the

                            can only be implemented if the collection average is described or

                    We somehow reconcile the different descriptions used in each of the systems and

            the algorithms and technologies available in order to access the resources or resource

Most implementations of resource-based interactions depend on three basic actions:</p><div class="book"><dl class="book"><dt class="calibre15"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Comparing resources</span></span></dt><dd class="calibre16"><p class="calibre5">A core step in any interaction is to compare a user requirement

                            or some measurable similarity. Resources whose descriptions are similar
                            to the description of an information need can be the output of a search
                            interaction; similar resources to a given resource can be the output of

                            in the interaction. Ranking resources according to their relevance for a
                            query is a typical interaction step in a ranking-based search system.
                            Sorting resources by update frequency is a typical step for a push-based

                            retailer that sells a resource. In a digital library context, the full

            differ.</p><p class="calibre5">Some might find it useful to distinguish primary interactions from ancillary
            interactions, that is, interactions that follow another interaction. For example, one
            can only annotate a resource after it has been retrieved (searched and located) from an
            organizing system. However, for the context of the book, we will consider all
            interactions similarly as a combination of actions. Ancillary interactions can then be
            interpreted as interactions based on a series of grouped actions that by themselves
            represent more basic interactions.</p><p class="calibre5">The next sections describe some common interactions in digital organizing systems. One
            way to distinguish among them is to consider the source of the algorithms that are used
            in order to perform them. We can mostly distinguish <span class="calibre1">information retrieval
                interactions</span> (e.g. search and browse), <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-80"><em class="firstterm">machine learning</em></a> interactions (e.g.
            cluster, classify, extract) or <span class="calibre1">natural language processing interactions</span>
            (e.g. named entity recognition, summarization, sentiment analysis, anaphoric
            resolution). Another way to distinguish among interactions is to note whether resources
            are changed during the interaction (e.g. annotate, tag, rate, comment) or unchanged
            (search, cluster). Yet another way would be to distinguish interactions based on their
            absolute and relative complexity, i.e. on the progression of actions or steps that are
            needed to complete the interaction. Here, we will distinguish interactions based on the
            different resource description layers they act upon</p><p class="calibre5">Retrieval interactions can be found in any organizing system. Search is probably the
            most common form of access in an organizing system. When looking through my closet to
            find a particular Hawaiian shirt, I perform a retrieval interaction, albeit without
            computational tools to support the interaction. Information retrieval interactions
            perform a combination of comparing, ranking and locating steps (often in this order, but
            not always). Any information retrieval interaction must contain a compare interaction to
            enable the selection of resources that will match a requirement in the

                    Resources and queries are compared by comparing the directions of vectors in an

                        (tf)</em></a></strong></span>. For each term, term frequency (tf) measures how

                    has an ability to summarize a resource. If a term, for example
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">apple</span>”</span>, appears frequently in a resource, we can assume that
                    one of the content topics of the resource is apples and that a query for
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">apple</span>”</span> should retrieve this resource. Only relying on term
                    frequency to determine the relevance of a resource for a query has a drawback:
                    if the term occurs in every resource in the repository, it has no distinguishing
                    power between resources. For example, if my organizing system contains resources
                    about apples, all resources are potentially relevant for an <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">apple</span>”</span>
                    query. Hence, there should be an additional mechanism to penalize the term
                    appearing in too many resources. This is done with the inverse document
                    frequency, which signals how often a term or property occurs in my
                    collection.</p><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-362" class="calibre1"></a><span class="calibre1"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-2441" href="#calibre_link-88"><em class="firstterm">Inverse document frequency

                        containing a particular term. The inverse document frequency (idf) for a
                        term is defined as idf<sub class="calibre25">t</sub> =
                            log(N/df<sub class="calibre25">t</sub>), where N is the total number of
                        documents. The inverse document frequency of a term decreases the more
                        documents contain the term, providing us with a discriminating factor for
                        the importance of terms in a query.</span> For example, in an apple
                    resource collection, an information retrieval interaction can handle a query for
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">apples oranges</span>”</span> by lowering the importance of
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">apples</span>”</span> and increasing the importance of
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">oranges</span>”</span> in the resources that are selected as result
                    set.</p><p class="calibre5">Another problem with term frequency measure occurs when resource descriptions
                    have different lengths (a very common occurrence in organizing systems). Let's
                    say a resource description contains 20 terms and apple appears 4 times. Another
                    resource description contains 200 terms and apple occurs 10 times. According to
                    the term frequency-based relevance, the second resource is more relevant because
                    it contains apple more often. However, the first resource has a much higher
                    concentration of apple: 20% of its content is apple, whereas apple occurs only
                    in a 5% concentration in the second resource. In order to compensate for
                    different resource descriptions lengths that would bias the term frequency count
                    and therefore the calculated relevance towards longer documents, the term
                    vectors are therefore normalized with respect to their length.</p><p class="calibre5">In a first step of a vector space search, resource descriptions are compared
                    with the terms in the query. Then, a metric combining the term frequency and the
                    inverse document frequency is used to rank resources according to their
                    relevance with respect to the query, whereby term frequency and inverse document
                    frequency are the indicators of relevance<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-144" href="#calibre_link-90" class="calibre1">513</a>]</sup>.</p></div><div class="book" title="9.4.2.2 Latent Semantic Indexing"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2443" class="firstname"></a>9.4.2.2 Latent Semantic Indexing</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1">Latent semantic indexing</span> is a variation of the vector space
                    model where a mathematical technique known as singular value decomposition is

                    co-occurrence of terms in a collection. Based on the terms that occur in all
                    resources in a collection, the method calculates which terms might be synonyms
                    of each other or are otherwise related. Put in another way, latent semantic
                    indexing groups terms into topics. Let's say the terms <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">roses</span>”</span> and
                        <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">flowers</span>”</span> often occur together in the resources of a particular
                    collection. The latent semantic indexing methodology recognizes statistically
                    that these terms are related. Now queries for <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">flower</span>”</span> will also
                    retrieve resources that mention <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">roses.</span>”</span> This increases the chances
                    of a resource being found relevant to a query even if the query terms do not
                    match the resource description terms exactly, and can therefore improve the
                    quality of the search in the system.</p><p class="calibre5">Another approach to add similar terms or properties to a search is to use a
                    controlled vocabulary or classification system of an organizing system. When a
                    query can be mapped to terms in the controlled vocabulary or classes in the
                    classification, the inherent category structure of the vocabulary or
                    classification can suggest additional terms (broader, narrower, synonymous)
                    whose occurrence in resources can signal their relevance for a query.</p></div><div class="book" title="9.4.2.3 Probabilistic Retrieval"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-2444" class="firstname"></a>9.4.2.3 <span class="firstname">Probabilistic Retrieval</span></h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">In contrast to the vector space model, the underlying idea of the

                    that a resource is relevant to an information need. The result of using a
                    probabilistic model is a ranked list of resources. The resources are ranked by

                    is the document and q is the query so that the resource with the highest
                    probability to be relevant is ranked highest. In the vector space model, by
                    comparison, the resource, whose term vector is most similar to a query term

                    idea of citation-based search is to use a known resource as the information need
                    and retrieve other resources that are related by citation.</p><p class="calibre5">Citation-based search can be implemented by directly following citations from
                    the original resource or to find resources that cite the original resource.
                    Another comparison technique is the principle of bibliographic coupling, where
                    the information retrieval system looks for other resources that cite the same
                    resources as our original resource. Citation-based search results can also be
                    ranked, for example by the number of in-citations a publication has received
                    (the PageRank popularity measure actually derives from this principle).</p></div><div class="book" title="9.4.3.3 Translation"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="author1"><a id="calibre_link-1645" class="firstname"></a>9.4.3.3 Translation</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">During <span class="calibre1">translation</span>, resources are transformed into another

                    that are performed in order to merge resources from different organizing systems
                    to prepare them for further interactions, a translation transforms the resource
                    after it has been retrieved or located. Dictionaries or parallel corpora are
                    external resources that drive a translation.</p><p class="calibre5">During a dictionary-based translation, every individual term (sometimes
                    phrases) in a resource description is looked up in a dictionary and replaced
                    with the most likely translation. This is a simple translation, as it cannot
                    take grammatical sentence structures or context into account. Context can have
                    an important impact on the most likely translation: the French word

            crucial part of every step from design, through implementation and especially during
            operation. Evaluating the quality of interactions at different times in the design
            process (design concept, prototype, implementation, and operation) reveals different
            issues (both strengths and weaknesses) to the designers or operators of the organizing
            system.</p><p class="calibre5">During the design and implementation stages, interactions need to be tested against
            the original goals of the interaction and the constraints that are imposed by the
            organizing system, its resources and external conditions. It is very common that
            processes in interactions are tweaked or tuned in order to achieve a closer compliance
            with the original goals and intentions for the interaction. Evaluation during these
            stages often attempts to provide a calculable way to measure this compliance and
            supports the fine-tuning process. It should be an integral part of an iterative design
            process.</p><p class="calibre5">During the later implementation and operation stages, interactions are evaluated with
            respect to the dynamically changing conditions of the organizing system and its
            environment. User expectations as well as environmental conditions or constraints can
            change and need to be checked periodically. A systematic evaluation of interactions
            ensures that changes that impact an interaction are observed early and can be integrated
            in order to adjust and even improve the interaction. At these stages, more subjective
            evaluation aspects like satisfaction, experience, reputation or <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">feel</span>”</span> also
            play a role in fine-tuning the interactions. This subjective part of the evaluation
            process is as important as the more quantitative, objective part. A lot of aspects
            during the design and implementation processes need to be considered and made to work
            together to enable an interaction to perform optimally. Ongoing quality evaluation and
            feedback ensures this process.</p><p class="calibre5">Let's assume that <span class="calibre1">Shopstyle.com</span> develops a new interaction
            that lets you compare coat lengths from the offerings of their various retailers. Once
            the interaction is designed, an evaluation takes place in order to measure whether all
            coats and their lengths are integrated in the interaction and whether the coat lengths
            are measured and compared correctly. The designers would not only want to know whether
            the coat lengths are represented correctly but also whether the interaction performs
            efficiently. When the interaction is ready to be released (usually first in beta or test
            status), users and retailers will be asked whether the interaction improves their
            shopping experience, whether the comparison performs as they expected and what they
            would change. These evaluation styles work hand in hand in order to improve the
            interaction.</p><div class="book" title="9.5.1 Interaction Aspects for Evaluation"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-23" class="firstname"></a>9.5.1 Interaction Aspects for Evaluation</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5">Evaluation aspects can be distinguished by the effort and time it takes to extract
                them for analysis or the effort and time to analyze them. They can also be
                distinguished by how quantifiable they are and therefore how easy to compare with
                other measures or similar measures in other organization systems. They can be
                distinguished by what component of the interaction or organizing system they focus
                on or by the discipline, expertise or methodologies that are utilized for the
                evaluation.</p><p class="calibre5">A common and important distinction is the difference between efficiency,
                effectiveness and satisfaction. An interaction is efficient, when it performs its
                actions in a timely and economical manner. An interaction is effective, when it
                performs its actions correctly and completely. An interaction is satisfactory when
                it performs as expected. Satisfaction is the least quantifiable of the evaluation
                aspects because it is highly dependent on individual tastes and experiences.</p><p class="calibre5">Efficiency measures are usually engineering evaluation aspects. Aspects like time
                to perform an action, number of steps to perform an interaction, amount of computing
                resources used. Effectiveness measures are often developed in the fields that
                developed the algorithm for the interaction, information retrieval or machine
                learning, for example. Satisfaction measures arise out of the interaction between a
                user and the organizing system and its designed interaction <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span>
                they are mostly aspects of user interfaces, usability, or subjective and aesthetic
                impressions.</p><p class="calibre5">Although efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction are measured differently and
                affect different components of the interaction, they are equally important for the
                success of an interaction. Even if an interaction is fast, it is not very useful if
                it arrives at incorrect results. Even if an interaction works correctly, user
                satisfaction is not guaranteed. One of the challenges in designing interactions is
                that these aspects often tradeoff each other. A fast system cannot be as precise as
                an interaction that takes time and a lot of context in consideration. An effective
                interaction might require a lot of effort from the user, which does not make it very
                easy to use, so the user satisfaction might decrease. It depends on the priorities
                of the organizing system and its designers to determine upon which properties to
                optimize the organizing system.</p><p class="calibre5">Let's continue our <span class="calibre1">Shopstyle</span> coat length comparison interaction
                example. When the coat length calculation is performed in an acceptable amount of
                time and does not consume a lot of the organizing systems resources, the interaction
                is efficient. When all coat lengths are correctly measured and compared, the
                interaction is effective. When the interaction is seamlessly integrated into the
                shopping process, is visually supported in the interface and is not cognitively
                exhausting, is it probably satisfactory for a user as it provides a useful service
                (especially for someone with irregular body dimensions). What aspect should
                Shopstyle prioritize? It will probably weigh the consequences of effectiveness
                versus efficiency and satisfaction. For a retail- and consumer-oriented organizing
                system, satisfaction is probably one of the more important aspects, so it's highly
                likely that efficiency and effectiveness might be sacrificed (in moderation) in
                favor of satisfaction.</p><p class="calibre5">For a lot of <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                    system</em></a> interactions, however, effectiveness is the more important
                aspect, particularly for those interactions that we have looked at so far. If search
                results are not correct, then users will not be satisfied by even the most usable
                interface. Many interactions are evaluated with respect to their ability to return
                relevant resources. Why and how this is evaluated, is the focus of the remainder of
                this section.</p></div><div class="book" title="9.5.2 Relevance"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title6"><a id="calibre_link-24" class="firstname"></a>9.5.2 Relevance</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre5"><span class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-481" class="calibre1"></a>The concept of <span class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre9"><a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-103"><em class="firstterm">relevance</em></a></strong></span> is pivotal in information retrieval and
                    machine learning interactions. Relevance is widely regarded as the fundamental
                    concept of information retrieval, and by extension, all of information science.
                    Despite being one of the more intuitive concepts in human communication,
                    relevance is notoriously difficult to define and has been the subject of much
                    debate over the past century.</span></p><p class="calibre5">Historically, relevance has been addressed in logic and philosophy since the
                notion of inference was codified (to infer B from A, A must be relevant to B). Other
                fields have attempted to deal with relevance as well: sociology, linguistics, and
                psychology in particular. Consider these theoretical views of relevance: subject
                knowledge view, subject literature view, logical view, system's view, destination's
                view, pertinence view, pragmatic view and the utility-theoretic interpretation,
                which address different perspective on the idea when something is relevant.<sup class="calibre11">[<a id="calibre_link-153" href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre1">522</a>]</sup> In 1997, Mizzaro surveyed 160 research articles on the topic of
                relevance and arrived at this definition: <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">relevance can be seen as a point in

                surrounding the concept.</p><p class="calibre5">For the purpose of <a class="calibre1" href="#calibre_link-28"><em class="firstterm">organizing
                    systems</em></a>, relevance is a concept for evaluating effectiveness that
                describes when a stated or implicit information need is satisfied by one or more
                resources considering a particular user context and a particular time. One of the
                challenges for the evaluation of relevance in organizing systems is the gap between
                a user's information need (not stated), and an expression of that information need
                (a query). This gap might result in ambiguous outcomes in the interaction. For
                example, somebody speaks the word <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">Paris</span>”</span> (query) into a
                travel-oriented organizing system application interface wanting advice on how to
                travel to Paris, France (information need). The response includes offers for the
                    <span class="calibre1">Paris Hotel</span> in Las Vegas. Does the result satisfy the
                information need? What if the searcher receives advice on Paris but has already seen
                every one of the resources the organizing system offers? What is the correct
                decision on relevance here?</p><p class="calibre5">The key to calculating effectiveness is to be aware of what is being measured. If
                the information need as expressed in the query is measured, the topical relevance or
                topicality <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> a system-side perspective is analyzed. If the
                information need as in a person's mind is measured, the pertinence, utility or
                situational relevance <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> a subjective personal perspective is
                analyzed. This juxtaposition is the point of much research and contention in the
                field of information retrieval, because topical relevance is objectively measurable,
                but subjective relevance is what should really be achieved. For evaluating
                interactions with respect to effectiveness, a first decision is what notion of
                relevance needs to be considered.</p><p class="calibre5">Another decision is whether recall or precision are preferred in an

                interaction has to cast a wide net and will not be very precise. In order to be very
                precise and only present relevant resources to the searcher, an interaction has to
                be very discriminating and will probably not find all relevant resources. When a
                collection is very large and contains many relevant resources for any given query,
                the priority is usually to increase precision. However, when a collection is small
                or the information need also requires finding all relevant documents (e.g. in case
                law, patent or medical diagnosis retrieval), then the priority is put on increasing
                recall.</p><p class="calibre5">The amount and specificity of the organization in an organizing system has a large
                impact on the trade-off between recall and precision (<a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45" title="Chapter 3. Resources in Organizing Systems">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>).
                When resources are organized in fine-grained category systems and many different
                resource properties are described, high-precision searches are possible because a
                desired resource can be searched as precisely as the description or organization of
                the system allows. However, very specialized description and organization may
                preclude certain resources from being found, consequently recall might be
                sacrificed. If the organization is superficial <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> like your
                sock drawer, for example <span class="calibre1">&ndash;</span> you can find all the socks you
                want (high recall) but you have to sort through a lot of socks to find the right
                pair (low precision). The trade-off between recall and precision is closely
                associated with the extent of the organization.</p></div></div><div class="book" title="9.6 Key Points in Chapter Nine"><div class="titlepage"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="calibre8"></div><h1 class="title3"><a id="calibre_link-26" class="firstname"></a>9.6 Key Points in Chapter Nine</h1></div></div></div><div class="book"><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="calibre5">Interactions arise naturally from the affordances of the resources or are

                        create content that can be easily imported into learning management systems. <span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre1">Common Cartridge</span></span> (<abbr class="calibre1">CC</abbr>) specifications give detailed
                        descriptions of the directory structure, metadata and information models
                        associated with a particular learning object. For example, a learning
                        package from a provider from <span class="calibre1">McGraw-Hill</span> may contain
                        content from a book, some interactive quizzes, and some multimedia to
                        support the text. CC specifies how files would be organized within a
                        directory, how links would be represented, how the package would communicate
                        with a backend server, how to describe each of the components, and the like.
                        This would enable a professor or a student using any capable learning
                        management system to import a <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">cartridge</span>”</span> or learning material
                        and have it appear in a consistent manner with all other learning materials
                        within the <abbr class="calibre1">LMS</abbr>. This means that content providers need not
                        maintain multiple versions of the same content just to conform to the
                        formats of different systems, allowing them to focus their resources on
                        creating more content as opposed to maintaining the ones they already have.
                        Looking at this in the context of the interoperability framework, we see
                        that while information from providers are in a structured digital form, the
                        main problem was that users were consuming the content using competing
                        systems that had their own data formats by which to accept content. Huge
                        publishers, wanting to increase distribution of their product, offered their
                        content in all these different formats. While the specifications that the
                            <abbr class="calibre1">LMS</abbr> created refer to the technical considerations in
                        creating content and tools, the process of getting to that point involved a
                        lot of organizational and political discussions. Internally, content and
                            <abbr class="calibre1">LMS</abbr> providers needed to set aside the necessary
                        resources to refactor their products to conform to the standards.
                        Externally, competing providers had to collaborate with one another to
                        create the specifications.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p class="calibre5"><sup class="calibre10">[<a id="calibre_link-43" href="#calibre_link-115" class="calibre1">485</a>] </sup>[Citation] Fidel, Raya (2012): <em class="firstterm">Human Information Interaction:

                                    the ability to deliver government services through electronic
                                    means. These services can range from government-to-citizen,
                                    government-to-business, government-to-employees,
                                    government-to-government, and vice-versa [Guijarro, 2006,
                                    Scholl, 2007]. This could range from a government unit providing
                                    a portal where citizens can apply for a driver's license or file
                                    their taxes, to more complex implementations such as allowing
                                    different government agencies to share certain pertinent
                                    information with one another, such as providing information on
                                    driver's license holders to the police. Because the government
                                    interacts with heterogeneous entities and their various systems,
                                    e-government planners must consider how to integrate and

                    their customers, which allow libraries to integrate their local catalogs with
                    central indexes of journal and other full-text databases. The advantages of

                                    represented, and data exchange formats describe how information
                                    is structured, communication protocols refer to how information

                                    are transmitted across the network. Things such as message

                                    being highly dependent on its position in the document. For
                                    instance, a line in an <abbr class="calibre1">EDI</abbr> document with

                            also becomes a problem when working across organizations. Fully
                            integrating systems between two companies, for instance, may entail the
                            exposure of business intelligence and information that should be kept
                            private. This type of exposure is too much for most businesses,
                            regardless of whether the relationship with the other business is
                            collaborative rather than competitive. There are security issues to be
                            considered, as collaborating organizations would need to access private
                            networks and secure servers. The heterogeneity in supporting organizing
                            systems along with the need to quickly evolve with the rapid changes in
                            an organization's competitive and collaborative environment has pushed
                            organizations to shift from more vertical, isolated structures to a more
                            loosely coupled, ecosystem paradigm This has led to more componentized
                            and modularized systems that need only to exchange information or
                            transform resources when an interaction requires it.</p><p class="calibre5">The emerging paradigm then is to enable independent systems to
                            interoperate, or to have <span class="calibre1">“<span class="calibre1">the ability of two or more systems or
                                components to exchange information and to use the information that
                                has been exchanged.</span>”</span> Because the focus is in the exchange of
                            resources or resource descriptions, independent systems need not
                            necessarily know other systems' underlying logic, for example how they
                            store the resources. What is important is knowing what kind of resource
                            is expected and in what description (notation, writing system,
                            semantics), and what kind of information is returned for a particular.
                            This is a strategic approach to exchanging resources, as systems can
                            remain highly independent of each other. Changes in one system need not
                            necessarily affect how other systems work as long as the information
                            that is sent and received through an interface stays the same. This
                            allows greater adaptability, as changes to system logic or business
                            processes can be done in self-contained modules without necessarily
                            affecting others. The transformation then happens in an intermediate
                            space where the agreements on resource descriptions are fixed.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p class="calibre5"><sup class="calibre10">[<a id="calibre_link-65" href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre1">496</a>] </sup>[LIS] To illustrate the difference between a unidirectional and

            renderers care much about size adjustments. Is problem in XHTML or CSS? </p><p class="calibre5">As a matter of style, I prefer to "size down" monospaced fonts because they are
            already easier to read and otherwise may generate a lot line height for a given em
            height. </p><p class="calibre5">As a matter of style, for any element or attribute content that is to be set in ALL
            CAPS should be "sized down" </p><p class="calibre5">A rule of thumb for sizing down is 80% or 90% of the current point size; that is,
            either 0.80 em or 0.90 em. Thus, if you are using 10-12 pt text, use 8 or 9 points for
            your caps. An alternative rule is the current point size minus 2 pts (1 em - 2 pt).
